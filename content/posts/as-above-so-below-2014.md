Just because I watched [_The Descent_](../the-descent-2005) yesterday and it reminded me of this movie, I had to watch it again. I could remember almost nothing about this and was quite surprised at the _Tomb Raider_-esque treasure hunting setup.

_The Descent_'s setup feels a bit more natural, as does most of that movie. _As Above, So Below_ is a found footage type movie, which I also completely forgot. It is more a gimmick than strictly necessary for any scares or suspense. I think in fact that **not** being a found footage movie, might have helped the suspense as it could leave the audience guessing what's real and what the characters might have imagined. Having an objective camera, at least for me, suggests that everything happens exactly as we see it. It also begs the question who recovers all the footage, because some of the cameras definately get left behind.

This film is sometimes scary, but gets lost a bit in it's treasure hunting plot and lore. Watchable, but not that scary.
