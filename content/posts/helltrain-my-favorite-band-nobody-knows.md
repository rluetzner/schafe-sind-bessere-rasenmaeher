I initially intended to post a few songs on Mastodon and talk about my history with [Helltrain](https://helltrain.bandcamp.com), but I quickly learned that this would be better suited to a blog post. So here we are...

I've had Helltrain stuck in my ears for about a week. In particular this morning the chorus to _Route 666_ was stuck on repeat, so I tortured my kids with a bit of "Dad music" while prepping breakfast. üòÅ

This is the first song I ever heard. I stumbled upon this band via a short album review on laut.de -- which weirdly enough is [still online](https://laut.de/Helltrain/Alben/Route-666-7364).

The article was released on the 25th October of 2004, so that dates my first encounter pretty well. ü§£

In hindsight it's a bit weird that the band resonated that much with me. This is way before I got into Amon Amarth -- over a decade even. Back in 2004 I mostly listened to AC/DC, Iron Maiden and the like. Clean vocals, mellow atmosphere. I think I even kept away from Metallica back then. I might have listened to Nine Inch Nails, but that doesn't really fit anywhere, does it? üòÖ

And along comes this rowdy aggressive in-your-face band and I was totally enamoured with it. I guess despite the growled vocals, the atmosphere of music is actually pretty upbeat. All their songs have a kind of low, "ringing" groove -- basically a wall of sound. And they are layered with high melodies, which is what makes them sound upbeat.

Pretty much the same explanation that I found for Mot√∂rhead: once I understood that it's basically Rock'n'Roll with distorted guitars I immediately understood why I liked them so much. üòÖ

Other than a lot of bands, I don't know much about Helltrain. They are a swedish band and have released 3 albums and a few loose tracks at the time I'm writing this. I also know that their drummer died a few years ago, but they've been active since. In fact, according to Bandcamp, the latest single _Mischief_ was released on the 26th of May 2023 -- this year!

They themselves describe their music as "Punk Ass Rot'n'Roll" (at least they used to üòÖ). I'd say it lives somewhere between being groovy as classic Rock'n'Roll songs, with the wall of sound that comes with a lot of metal and aggressively growled vocals. There's also an organ in there sometimes. üòÅ

Apparently nowadays they go by Death'n'Roll, which is fine by me.

Very similar though to other bands, I tend to forget about Helltrain for years until suddenly a chorus or a certain melody pops into my mind and I go: "Hell yeah, that was a great band. I should listen to them again."

So Rock'n'Roll Devil was released in 2008 and I probably listened to it two or three years later and was delighted to have a new Helltrain album.

I remember not liking it much when I listened to it for the first time, but it snuck it's way into my ear after a while. However, to this day it remains their album I've listened to the least. I should remedy that immediately. ü§£

Relistening to it today, I think it was just a bit too dark at the time. While there are still some amazingly groovy songs that make you want to drop everything to dance and jump around like a maniac, there are also some more tempered and thoughtful -- dark -- songs like _My little stars_.

And holding up the tradition of forgetting about the band, I was overjoyed -- probably also three or so years later -- when I heard that they had released _Death is coming_ in 2012.

It remains the only album that I don't physically own, because -- hold on to your hats -- they released it and all their previous albums as a **free** download on their homepage https://helltrain.net [^website-redirect]. I always wanted to throw some money their way, because I wanted the physical release, but it looks like I missed my chance. üò¢

Anyway, queue the "same old, same old" -- I didn't like it when I first listened to it. Especially the opening tracks are either much heavier or much more aggressive. I've since come around on both of them. _Juggernauters_ sets the mood just right and _Death is coming_ is a great heavy, slow-groove song.

Relistening to the song right now, I'm not sure if _slow_ is the right word. I kinda always only think of the chorus which has this amazing "Death is co**ming**" growl in it that slows it down a bit. üòÖ

And next to these heavy hitters there is _The killer come_. Nothing to add, I rest my case. There's a real nice surprise at the end. üòÅ This is fucking great Rock'n'Roll!!!

If you're wondering about the surprise...

I always feel a bit sad that there's not more talk about Helltrain. Even though there are as many swedish metal bands as there are grains of sand, I feel that Helltrain has what it takes to rise above the rest -- oh wait...

Okay I have to mention it, because depending on which tracks you listen to, you'll be able to hear it for yourself. The singer doesn't exactly have a healthy way of growling. This is unproblematic when you're recording an album and can take all the time you need to get it right, but it will break your neck in live performances.

I really want to believe that Helltrain are a real fun live band, but the only watch- and listenable recording I found online is this here...

{{< yewtube id=-gtGYXESHQM title="Death in Kyiv, Ukraine a full live concert by Helltrain" >}}

You can tell that his voice tires quickly and he's hoarse and barely singing after just a few songs. I'm not a professional singer, so I can't really tell if what I'm saying is accurate, but to me it doesn't sound healthy -- it sounds like it should really **hurt**. üò¨

It's also possible that this one sample recording I have is not representative of their live performance and I really, really, really want to believe that that's the case.

Anyway, I do hope that the guys are happy doing what they do, because I am still very much happy to listen what they put out. Here's to more from my favorite band nobody knows. üçª
