## tl;dr

ToDo: Move to bottom, possibly with link.

- Be yourself, but don't be an asshole. The easiest way to do that is enable other people to be themselves too.
- Accept yourself. You can change, but change is hard and slow. Figure out if you actually need to change.
- Don't make your happiness dependent on other people. Are you doing something that makes you happy? Or are you trying to make someone else happy?
    - Red flags:
        - I'll make my mom proud by ...
        - If I say ..., then they'll like me.
    - Pitfalls:
        - Remember that there is still room for compromises. Try to get to a comfortable place, but allow other's to do the same.
- Don't make your happiness dependent on achieving certain goals.
    - Red flags:
        - If I finish ..., then ... will happen.
        - I'll be happy when...
    - Pitfalls:
        - Apathy doesn't help either. Allow yourself some downtime, but try to find an occupation (as in something that _occupies_ your mind, hands, ...) that you enjoy.

## Where I come from

I can't exactly put my finger on the one event, day or even year I lost control over my self-esteem. In hindsight, I think it slowly slipped from my grasp during the early school years.

I was never popular, but I always had friends. Real friends. The kind that will stick with you, no matter what other kids say. And we all know kids can say a lot of things. A lot of hurtful things.

Well...I had friends right up to the point where I had none. A few times in short succession.

My mom married again when I was 9, so we moved to a different town, about 50km from where I grew up. I switched school after 3rd grade and had the displeasure of being _the new kid_ in 4th grade. I took some beatings (most of which I don't remember, but my mom brings them up now and then), but ultimately made some friends. When the year ended I even managed to make friends with most of the kids who bullied me initially.

After 4th grade we Germans switch to what probably kinda aligns with _high school_. Or maybe this comparison is bad, I'm not sure. Anyway, I started attending a German Gymnasium -- together with only two girls from my last class. I didn't know either of them and I sure as shit didn't know any of the other kids. It didn't help that we moved town again, so the newfound friends from 4th grade were no longer in walking distance.

Again, I managed to make friends eventually. I got to keep some of them for almost two years -- until they decided to split up our class in 7th grade. Anybody who wanted to learn latin as their second language got to be in 'B' class, whereas I got shunted to 'D' class -- at that time widely known to be the worst kids in our grade.

This time it took longer. My next real _friends_ memory is about a year later in 8th grade, but in all honesty, my memory is most likely messing with me there.

I do however remember bullying. Lots and lots of bullying that kept up for years. I'd say it stopped somewhere around 11th grade, where I finally broke down crying in P.E. (or _sports_ as we Germans call it). I do remember trying to choke a guy (not really -- I was mostly shaking him) for calling me a baby for crying.

{{< aside >}}
I still think about this scene a lot, because the guy I ended up attacking turned out to be real solid and a loyal friend, once we both got to know each other. We've been out of touch for years, but I still count him amongst my few remaining school friends.
{{</ aside >}}

That brings me to the end of Gymnasium, where I followed my then girlfriend to Freiburg to study at university. I had lost (and replaced) my core group of friends shortly after I got together with the girl. According to them I "didn't want to hang out anymore" and they would rather spend time with my ex anyway. I was real sad about this for a long time and still feel like part of the blame lies with me, even though this forced split seems childish and mean.

So, new city, new school/university, no friends (except my girlfriend) and a timetable that was filled to the brink and didn't leave much time for socializing. At that point I was also pretty much convinced that I had forgotten how to make friends.

However, I had unbelievable luck in running into a very sociable guy in my very first university class. He invited me and a couple of other people to a _getting to know each other_ party the same week. That opened up a secondary social circle for me, next to the people my girlfriend hung out with. Three people at that party (not the host -- interestingly enough) are still amongst my best and closest friends today.

{{< aside >}}
I like the following story too much not to tell it, even though it's beside the point.

I wasn't immediate friends with the people I met at that party. We acknowledged and greeted each other, but as I've mentioned before I had too little time to join study groups and too little energy to go out in the evenings, so I couldn't really deepen or even start a relationship.

One late afternoon, when I was leaving a mandatory exercise group for one of my classes, I met the nice (then) couple from the party again. They were meeting up with some other people for a study group.

At first I greeted them as usual and was almost ready to move on, but something stopped me. After a short inner struggle, I sidled up on the table and asked them how they were getting along with the excercises. We did a bit of small talk, until something in me broke. Like a dam holding back too much water. I think we had spent a few precious words on topics outside of university and suddenly I started sprouting words like there was no tomorrow. After a while I remember -- mid sentence -- switching to something like this:

"bla, bla, bla -- you need to really stop me if I'm talking too much. This is honestly the most I've talked in weeks. I feel like all the people around me walk around like machines and anything they want to talk about is fucking university, maths, physics, excercise sheets. Argh! I don't want to talk about studying all the fucking time! It's depressing! I have classes the whole damn week and then on top of them I'm expected to hand in excercise sheets almost every day (where I had to achieve a minimum amount of points to be allowed to take the final exam). It probably sounds like whining to you and I totally believe that you're in the very same spot, but it's fucking killing me! I need to spend at least some time talking about normal stuff."

**Silence.**

"You know what, Robert? Care to join me for a cigarette?", the guy asked.

"Thanks, but I don't smoke."

"Then join me for some fresh air. Let's talk about normal stuff."

And we've been friends ever since. Years later, and after many a beer, he told me that these exact thoughts had been rattling around his brain as well and he was amazed that I could put them into words and that I had the guts to speak them and make myself vulnerable in front of a group of people I didn't know all that well. And I promptly admited that at that point I was too far gone and simply didn't care anymore. Things couldn't get any worse than they were.

But what drew him in, according to him, was not courage to speak these words, but openness and honesty. And this is where we return to my story.
{{</ aside >}}

Funny enough (not that funny at the time) my girlfriend broke up with me after just a few months living together. I was stuck in a city that was still strange to me, but I was no longer alone. When I told my new friends that I'd be looking for a new flat soon and didn't want to live alone, I was amazed and surprised to find myself with a new _flatmate to be_ and companion in looking for flats.

And although there's a bit more to the story, this is where things started to look up. I realized that I had scheduled too many classes for my first semester. I planned it out a bit better, so the next semesters allowed for much more free time. I had my friends close around me all the time and we dragged each other through the excercise sheets. We drank a lot and had soul searching, self reflecting discussions -- as you do as an early twenty year old university student. We gamed, we partied, we did a whole bunch of crazy shit.

But I also got complacent. I was in a good place. I fell in love with another girl about a year and a half after my last relationship had ended. And for a while everything seemed perfect.

But then -- after almost seven years -- we broke up with each other. And even though I had initiated the breakup, it tore me apart. I fell into a deep hole and even though I was still living with my friends, I kept mostly to myself. The few times I ventured out I had to force myself, even though I love these people with all my heart.

## The cogs start turning

And then something amazing happened. I must have read it somewhere, but I can't remember where or who said it. Sorry _original author who helped me a lot_.

**I realized that I can't make my own happiness dependent on other people.**

What does this mean exactly? Well, in my case I noticed that I had to be in a romantic relationship to think of myself as lovable. And I managed to reframe this, because there's absolutely no reason why this should depend on a _romantic_ relationship. I didn't have **plenty** friends, but those I had had stuck with me for over a decade at this point. And just to build a supporting structure: if I can keep friends around me and we still like each other after a decade, then no matter what happens, I'm a person that at least certain people like having around. And it turns out, that I like to have exactly these kinds of people around me as well.

That unlocked something else, because I had at that point been desperately seeking to get myself into another (romantic) relationship. After a bit of introspection, I realized that I could also enjoy the freedom of not having a partner. I did some online dating at the time and I was suddenly able to enjoy meeting new people again. The pressure of meeting _Miss Right_ had evaporated.

And with that pressure gone, I was finally ready to sit down and reflect on what attributes I like in people, which I find mildly irritating, but tolerable and which I absolutely can't fucking stand. In retrospect it seems impossible to want to meet _Miss Right_ without having these criterea nailed down.

These were the big steps, but my transformation started a few years earlier. I noticed that my study subject -- physics -- no longer interested me. I had been on board for classical mechanics, but quantum mechanics quickly lost my interest (even though I ended up groking most of it back then).

Instead I rekindled my love for programming. There wasn't much to do in the physics department, but whenever something needed doing, people soon started coming to me. And not just friends or co-workers (during my master's thesis), but people that had been sent to me by either of them.

So when the time came to decide if I wanted to continue with an PhD, I firmly said "No". No to the professor who had mentored me during my master's thesis and would have gladly kept me. No to my mom who was "happy I made it this far, but a PhD would have been amazing". But I said Yes to myself, because working for my thesis I had seen how much energy and devotion PhD students put into their experiments -- and I simply couldn't imagine myself dedicating countless hours and weekends into something I didn't really want or need.

I learned to listen to gut feelings. Not necessarily follow them at all times, but at least give them a chance to state their opinion. After my graduation I went job hunting. I declined some jobs that sounded good on paper, but where the atmosphere in the interview just didn't _feel right_.

After almost a year of unemployment -- and burning through the last of my savings -- I sent out an application to an IT company. I didn't really expect any response, because I had nothing to show for myself. My application basically said "I'm an okay programmer, but you'll have to take my word for it". I got invited for an interview. I remember showing up on one of the hottest days of 2016 in full business suit attire. I met the entire programming team -- three people at the time. All three of them were wearing flip-flops, shorts and t-shirts and at that very moment I had already decided that this is exactly where I want to be. **This** felt _right_. And incidentally, this is still the company I'm working with today in 2023. And that's even after I gave a presentation on a videogame I coded along a YouTube tutorial in which you shot fireballs and shotguns at cats. That however is a story for another day.

And in all these places -- friends, work and ultimately romance -- I could suddenly relax into being myself.

## You son of a ...

So...let's get this out of the way...

I am privileged and even for that I have been extremely lucky. The problems I've described here have been the biggest struggles in my life and I'm aware that they pale in comparison to some other people's lives.

I've had some money troubles, but I never went hungry. I boozed it away or spent it on games/movies most of the time and had to scrounge for scraps to pay the rent at the end of the month. Nothing to be proud of here.

I've been single, but I've also had multiple long lasting romantic relationships. The longest time I was single (after my first girlfriend) was one and a half years. I know a whole bunch of people that have been searching for a partner much longer than I ever have.

I've been completely without friends, but never too long. And I always came out with a strong group of friends that pulled me out of whatever hole I dug myself in.

I'm lucky to have found these amazing people and be born with such a supportive mom. And I ultimately found _Miss Right_ -- pretty much right after I realized I didn't have to force it -- and she's given me the most potent self-esteem boost by loving me exactly the way I am.

I'm privileged and your situation might be different. It might be a situation I can't even imagine in my worst nightmares.

If you came here for help and didn't find it, I'm truly sorry.

If these words have hurt you in any way, I'm truly and deeply sorry.

But if I manage to touch a single person, give the cogs in their brain that little push they needed, I think it was still worth it.
