Warning!!!

This contains heavy spoilers for the tv show.

Actually, I would say that knowing almost **anything** about this is a spoiler. So if you think you might like this, give it a go and come back once you've watched it! ðŸ™‚

These six one-hour episodes are a wild ride that is worth experiencing. And they are worth being experienced without any prior knowledge.

The main focus of this show is Lucy Chambers, a single mom with a kid that is seemingly plagued by schizophrenia and is suffering from some type of autism. Isaac, the little boy, is unable to experience or express any feelings, although he is well able to differentiate them in others.

Lucy regularly wakes up at 3.33 in the night and finds Isaac creepily staring at things only he can see. The mom starts having visions herself, where she sees people get murdered.

Next to this couple we have DI Dhillon, an ambitious and intelligent police officer, who's trying to solve multiple murders that seem unrelated. Their paths cross when he discovers that the killer is looking for Lucy.

The first two episodes of _The Devil's Hour_ manage to build up a very creepy atmosphere that often reminded me of a mix between _The Babadook_ and _The Sixth Sense_. That is surely related to a little boy having unexplained visions and the single mom struggling with the complicated relationship to her son, but it manages to be much more than a mere knockoff.

After building up this opressive, creeping sense of dread and waiting for the unavoidable jump scare to happen, I got the rug pulled out from under me. Suddenly, in the third episode, the series introduces parallel universes. Isaac specifically is able to see into other realities and even manages to slip over into another timeline.

While this takes away the fear of the unknown -- so far we've only ever heard Isaac describe people watching him -- it replaces this fear with intrigue. At least it did so for me. Bit by bit we're handed out more information about the visions Lucy and Isaac are having. It turns out that they are glimpses of other realities. Well kinda... They are also memories of past lives -- which makes this feel a bit like _Memento_.

I felt the pieces slowly moving into place while watching this, but every episode would take one of these puzzle pieces and alter its form slightly. Often with a better fit than what I had thought of before. The show kept introducing new aspects of this time travelling memory ability and always kept me on my toes.

Lucy and DI Dhillon finally manage to track down Gideon Shepherd -- the killer. We've seen glimpses of him before in short scenes from an interrogation cell. All actors are doing remarkable jobs, but, next to the child actor playing Isaac, Peter Capaldi as Gideon steals the show. He has such an uncanny energy and manages to portray Gideon both as a relatable victim of circumstance and a mentally unstable killer.

That also makes sense when we finally discover that he's awakened to this time loop by remembering his own death. He averts his and his brother's fate by stabbing their father. Over many iterations, which he forcefully restarted by taking his own life, he refines his vanishing act. Seeing that he's able to affect his own fate, he starts saving other lives.

One life he saves is that of Lucy's mother. For the most part we've seen the older woman suffering from the same kind of schizophrenia Isaac experiences, although she's much further gone. With Gideons explanation we learn that Lucy's mother is (still) struggling with her state of being alive overlapping with other realities where she's died.

Isaac is yet another thing entirely. After Lucy's mother died, Lucy led a totally different life without children. Isaac is burdened by knowing that he only exists in one of the timelines and "should not be here".

The first season ends with Isaac discovering a way to channel his feelings towards his mother, but he's tragically trapped in a house fire while Lucy is in the interrogation room with Gideon.

His (absolute unlikable piece-of-shit dick of a) father tells us that he "went back for him, but couldn't find him", so it's likely that Isaac survives by slipping into another reality. However the distraught Lucy runs into the burning building and seemingly suffocates from the fumes while we see scenes from her other lives play out.

Now, I absolutely liked every minute of _The Devil's Hour_. The camera and sparse music emphazise the tense atmosphere. All actors were well casted and do an amazing job. The story is intelligent and kept me guessing and hooked up until the very end.

Here's what I tooted while watching the show:

Heyho! Robert from the future here!

I set my toots to expire and forgot that I had embedded some of them here.

They are gone forever, but probably said a bunch of "WTF is going on".

But...

After watching the season finale, I found out that the show had been renewed for a second and possibly even third season.

ðŸ«¤

Well... I'm thrilled to see these actors back in their roles.

And I will most definitely watch the other season(s).

However, I feel like the writers might have spent all their ammo on the first season. It reminds me a bit of the first season of _Carnival Row_ which ended with a very specific plot hook that promised to take the show in a direction I didn't much care for. I was in it for the scary, unexplained, creepy stuff.

_The Devil's Hour_ ends up very much the same. I'm glad I watched it, but the mystery feels pretty much resolved for me. I'm not sure how well the show will hold up without the creepy atmosphere and the now-explained time travel memories.

Nevertheless, I heavily recommend giving this a watch. As it stands, it's one of the best mini-series I've watched. ðŸ¤©

Let's hope they can follow this up. ðŸš€
