Here's something I didn't think we'd ever get: a new Monkey Island from Ron Gilbert. And as expected it fits in perfectly with the first two Monkey Island games.

My first contact with the Monkey Island series was with **The Curse of Monkey Island**. I did not know at that time that it was the third entry in the series, but I remember enjoying the humor and slapstick. I didn't get much further than the second chapter as a kid, although I finished it sometime later with a walkthrough. I tried to get through it about a year or so ago, but got stuck again in the second chapter, although on a different problem. I distinctly remember solving that on my own as a kid, but for the life of me couldn't remember the solution.

**Return to Monkey Island** retcons the ending of **Monkey Island 2** in what I thought to be very fitting with the humor of the entire series. Many people (including myself) were hoping for a good explanation as to what the hell happened after the epic fight. I feel like Ron Gilbert knew that as well and found a way to recontextualize the ending of **Monkey Island 2** without actually explaining anything.

I'm still a bit torn about the graphics the game uses. For the most part I like the asymmetrical cartoon like characters and environments. There are however some rather disgusting close-ups that reminded me of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ , which I never really could get warm with. Even though interactable objects now mesh much better with the backgrounds than they did in earlier entries, I never had trouble identifying them. It also helps that there is a button to show objects markers, although I used it less than I was expecting to.

Another modern adventure game thing is that Guybrush carries a hint book with him. I do welcome the idea and I was tempted to use it two or three times during my playthrough. In the end however I stumbled upon all solutions without resorting to the hint book. I think there was only one puzzle that had me stumped for a really long time until I stumbled upon the solution rather by accident. I'd be interested how the _easy puzzles mode_ plays and which steps it removes.

The game took me around 8 hours to complete and I'm very glad that I got to play this. On the one hand the game got a few good laughs and lots of chuckles out of me, but also felt more mature than the earlier entries. Guybrush is older now and the pirating world around him has moved on. Being quite a few years older than when I picked up the third installment, the theme of getting older resonated strongly with me. The ending might be just as divisive as the ending of **Monkey Island 2** was, but I personally liked it quite a bit. All in all this is a clear recommendation on my part. Go and play this, if you haven't already!
