This is a de(s)cent movie! üòÅ

I always get this mixed up with [_As Above, So Below_](../as-above-so-below-2014), mostly because I know that both movies take place in caves. Whereas I had seen _As Above, So Below_ before, _The Descent_ was a new experience for me.

The film tells the story of an all female group of friends that go caving together. During the trip they find out that they are not as close knit friends as they thought they were.

Also: there's something down there!!!

This movie keeps the suspense up almost from the beginning and up 'til the very end. There are a few very effective jump scares and the ending really caught me by surprise. This is well worth a watch!
