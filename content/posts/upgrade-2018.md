Someone wrote in to mention this movie in one of the latest WOFF dispatch episodes I've heard. Whoever wrote in compared it to _Venom_ and that is actually spot on. This movie is also brilliant.

A violent mugging leaves a mechanic as a quadroplegic and without a wife. He decides to go through with an experimental operation that will implant STEM, an AI that can control his body into his spine. Together they take revenge on the muggers.

It's funny, without being overly slapstick. It's suspenseful. It is well acted and although the plot is not entirely original, they take it into an interesting direction. It also has some completely unexpected outburst of violence and gore and had me cackling maniacally a few times.

The ending is also very bleak, which is something that I will always like in movies. I initially thought that I saw the ending coming miles and miles away, but they actually managed to put a satisfying surprising twist on it.
