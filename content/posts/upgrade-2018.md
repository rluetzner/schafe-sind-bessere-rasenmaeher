Someone wrote in to mention this movie in one of the latest WOFF dispatch episodes I've heard. Whoever wrote in compared it to Venom and that is actually spot on. This movie is also brilliant.

It's funny, without being overly slapstick. It's suspenseful. It is well acted and although the plot is not entirely original, they take it into an interesting direction. It also has some completely unexpected outburst of violence and gore and had me cackling maniacally a few times.
