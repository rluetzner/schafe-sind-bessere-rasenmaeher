[Archive.org](https://archive.org) has been through a lot of trouble in the last few weeks. Multiple DDoS attacks, a huge leak of sensitive data and constant legal trouble.

I can remember neither the author, nor in which context specifically I ran across the following statement. It went something like this.

> We're obsessed with preserving content for "the future", but there's no rhyme or reason as to what we want to archive.
>
> Imagine digging up Pharaoh Ramses' shopping list.
>
> It needs to be okay when things get lost.

At first I vaguely agreed with this statement, but it's been bugging me for a while now.

If we're really looking 2000 years into the future, I totally agree that it's "okay when things get lost". There's a ton of things on Archive.org that simply won't matter in 100, 200 or 1000 years.

But are we really talking about that time frame though?

I haven't used Archive.org extensively. The most relevant thing I can remember is downloading ISOs for Resident Evil 1 (1996), Resident Evil 2 (1998) and Resident Evil 3 (1999). These games were unavailable for the longest time until [GOG](https://gog.com) made them available again **a few months ago**! [^resi]

There were a few other old games I looked up on Archive.org. I browsed a few old manuals and looked at long gone websites with the _Wayback Machine_.

We're not talking about 2000 year old information getting lost!!!

We're actually looking at media that was created **in my lifetime** and which is slowly, but surely being swept away.

Just recently I read a post on the Fediverse about how people of all ages were watching a screening of Akira Kurosawa's _Seven Samurai_ in the movie theater. A grandpa went to watch it with their teenage grandchild. A couple around my age were watching it for the first time.

Imagine not being able to watch this movie that came out 70 years ago (in 1954)!

Or _Star Wars_ (1977).

Or how about reading Orwell's 1948 masterpiece _1984_ -- more relevant than ever!?

All of these are pretty easy to come by. They were released as physical media.

But as you may have noticed, this no longer happens.

"Physical" videogame releases are tied to online platforms, e.g. Steam, and the package you can buy often just contains a key to register the game.

Amazon, Sony, Netflix and other streaming services have been caught removing or editing digital media. Media that is **only** available digitally -- or have you seen physical copies of the last few _Stranger Things_ seasons?

Additionally, after a lot of legal fights, these services are now forced to admit you are not actually _buying_ digital media. Steam and Amazon now prominently display that they are just _licensing_ this media to you. A license that gives those companies any rights to revoke it at any time.

Also...are these companies gonna be around in 2000 years for you to access your copy of _Dark Souls_? Probably not!

And this isn't limited to popular streaming services. Think about scientific papers, which are gated by a few publishers which want insane amounts of money for information that should be free to be shared, discussed and learned from.

So while we are indeed "obsessed" with preserving things, you'll need to look behind the curtain and see what's causing it. People are slowly waking up to this mass destruction of media -- again, things that have been created in the last few decades.

It's okay when things get lost.

I don't care if archaeologists in the far future discover a scratched copy of Resident Evil or not.

But I do care if I can show my kids my favorite videogames, movies or books when they grow up.

[^resi]: I do actually own all three games physically, but they are lost somewhere in the chaotic bowels of my cellar. I also bought digital copies as soon as GOG announced them.
