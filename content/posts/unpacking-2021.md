This is a _beeeeautiful_ game. And very relaxing. As the title suggest you're unpacking moving boxes and placing the unpacked items in very pretty pixel-art rooms.

Coming fresh off of **Return to Monkey Island** I clicked through the first few stages very quickly. But even so I started placing items more deliberately and grouping matching objects (e.g. books) together. I also quickly noticed recurring items, which the unnamed (and unseen) person keeps between places.

Although there is no explicit story, a lot is told with the environments and objects that you are unpacking. One stage hints at a very sad experience that most of us will be able to relate to. The music manages to underline the themes of the different stages perfectly without getting in the way.

The gameplay is very simplistic, but that is also the point. There is no time limit, no score, no wrong or right. Except for what you might find aesthetically pleasing or not. It's a nice little meditation and although I see no real replay value and the game is pretty short I would still fully recommend this as an experience.
