I had trouble getting to sleep last night and my mind kept returning to games that I'd call _classic_. I was born in 1987, so my definition will most likely differ from yours. Also, after finishing this list I realized that my brain got stuck on violent games. There's a bunch of classic games left that I'm not going to talk about here.

## Resident Evil 2 (1998)

With the release of Resident Evil 2 Remake, I can't help but enforce the **1998** whenever I mention this game. I really enjoyed the remake, but it will never take the place of the original game (other than Resident Evil Remake, which you'll find further down).

The PC port was released sometime in 1999. That surprised me at first, because I could have sworn that the following memory was from 97 or 98, but it doesn't really matter.

Until then I hadn't really been a PC gamer. My mom had bought an Aldi PC (at that time famous for being cheap, but powerful) a few years prior, but she kept it under lock and key. I snuck in a few play sessions, but I was only able to do so when I was home alone. Lacking a Playstation or N64 and without access to the family PC, I think I was still playing GameBoy and Super Nintendo games back then.

And then -- one fateful afternoon -- a friend from school showed me Quake and Resident Evil 2.

He was really into the gib-fest that was the original Quake, which at that point felt disgusting and wrong to me. This was the first time I was exposed to such graphic violence. I've never been a violent person and seeing that _pointless_ brutality made my stomach turn.

Thinking about it now sounds ridiculous, but more on that later.

So while my friend was cheating his way to all weapons and cackling while blowing apart soldiers, dogs and Lovecraftian monsters with a rocket launcher, I got paler and paler.

"Pretty cool, huh?", he asked me after a while. And I must have answered something like "yeah, I guess..."

He could see that I was not convinced, so he shut down Quake and opened up something else.

This game starred a policeman (I wasn't saying _cop_ at that time) with a submachine gun (we were playing _arranged mode_). It started out on a city street that was partially on fire and the player character was surrounded by moaning, bloodthirsty Zombies.

Even though my friend tried it's best to make this look like a run and gun game, mowing down Zombies left and right with unlimited submachine gun ammo, I realized that this was something else.

First of all, the setting fascinated me. Other than Quake, which I had seen minutes before, and games that I'd played up to that point, this one took place in the real world. At least in the sense that it wasn't some blocky sci-fi complex, cave system or fantasy world.

There were cars and shops, newspapers, dumpsters and alleyways. There were even other people, 3D models, with which the player could interact. Well, I'm talking about Kendo in his gun shop and interact might be stretching it a little, but it impressed me at the time.

We followed along the streets and even went through a bus where we were forced to stomp on a Zombie's head. With the gun ammo we were collecting, it become pretty obvious to me that the unlimited submachine gun wasn't how the game was meant to be played. I also saw tons of possiblities to get around the enemies without spending ammo. I had already started to tactically disect the first few screens.

Finally we ended up in what looked like an abandonned police station. We found a sole survivor who talked a bunch and then out of nowhere pointed a gun at us. I mean, we realized that the characters were speaking English, but back then we both didn't understand what was going on.

With the newly aquired key card we set about exploring the police station. Which basically means that we ran into the first Licker and got our ass handed to us. We were both scared shitless. My friend was spraying bullets everywhere -- except where the Licker was -- and ended up brutally killed by the Licker slicing off Leon's head.

The Game Over ended our excursion, because my friend got frustrated. Quake returned to the screen, but Resident Evil refused to leave my mind.

Even back then I was reflecting on why the violence and gore of RE 2 didn't trigger me in a way Quake did. Ultimately I think that it's the different context.

Yes, the city streets and the police station where filled with pooling blood and gory corpses (both living and dead). And yes, there was a monster with sharp claws that could rip the player's head off. I also didn't forget the mob of Zombies noisily feeding on a corpse in the foreground.

But it fit the scenario, the narrative. The player was scrounging for ammo, desperately trying to survive. These monsters had overrun the city, of course there's blood and dead people everywhere. And we gotta shoot 'em, before they get us.

Quake felt like a power fantasy I didn't want to engage in (yet). Resident Evil 2 felt disempowering in a way that really spoke to me.

It was obvious that my friend wasn't interested in the game, so I borrowed it and sneakily installed it on our family PC. I have the specs burned into my memory, because the original PC port of RE 2 required at least a 166 MHz processer and our Aldi PC only had 133 MHz. So I played the game in slow motion. It's funny to think of it, but I remember it running with a constant, but lower framerate. The game didn't stutter, it actually just ran in slow motion all the time.

I played it for a while, but eventually stopped. Not due to it running slow -- I had the patience for it back then -- but because it was too hard! I had no idea what to do or where to go, I couldn't read the item descriptions and worst of all you couldn't save!

I unlocked the _save skill_ a few years later when I returned to beat the game. This time equipped with better English, but still rocking the keyboard. I think with a bit of practice I could restore the muscle memory. I know that V sprints and cancels and X aims the gun. Pretty sure that Y is the action button.

And I can still remember how I had my mind blown when it turned out that I hadn't finished the game, but merely the _A_ scenario. And then Mister X showed up and the fear came rushing back.

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** hell yeah, it does! I just replayed it recently and it's still an amazing game. I modded the shit out of it with upgraded visuals and sounds (and the convenient quick turn). I also played a bit of it without mods and it still looks pretty good.

**Should you play it:** hmmm...that one's tricky to answer. I grew up with Resident Evil tank controls, so they don't bother me, but I've heard that other people seem to bounce off of the old Resi games due to that. With the remake out, I lack good arguments to send you back to 1998, even though ultimately I think that the original is slightly better.

{{</ aside >}}

## Quake II (1997)

I honestly can't remember when or how I got in touch with Quake II. It must have been 2001 or 02 -- I can't remember when I bought my first PC. But I remember that it had a GeForce 2 MX and Windows ME (Millenium Edition). I've heard bad things about Win ME, but I got along with it just fine until I eventually switched to Windows XP.

I probably picked this up at a time when I was actively seeking out violent games. Even though my first exposure made me sick to my stomach, I couldn't drop the fascination after that fateful afternoon I recounted above.

I picked up the original Quake a few more times, but never came to enjoy it very much. The over the top violence and bloody gibs didn't bother me anymore, but the levels felt disjointed. I was pushed from sci-fi complexes to caves to medieval castles. And I was fighting medieval knights, flying demons and Yetis with weapons I didn't enjoy. Well, except for the Shotgun -- which has been my go to weapon since RE 2.

But Quake II was different. Even though it was a sci-fi scenario, it had (mostly) realistic weapons and a coherent world. You could (and later even had to) go back between different levels. Hitting the elevator (or replace with whatever other method of transport) button would no longer just dump you into a totally different level.

And the death animations were new to me. Even though I quickly realized that they weren't connected to hurt boxes, I was surprised at how many of them existed. Enemies would drop to their knees and spend their last breath to fire off a few more shots. The head would vanish off of the enemies with machine gun hands, but they would wildly spray gunfire while they collapsed.

Even though my English was still lacking at that point, I understood the plot well enough to feel like my pressence on the alien planet was making a difference. I destroyed a gigantic planetary defense gun, for christ's sake!!!

And, because I'm barbaric and had no one to teach me, I played all of this using the arrow keys to move and turn, Shift to run, CTRL to shoot and PgUp and PgDown to look around. Yup. Did it without mouse look. On hard.

And I tried it again a few years ago and failed misserably. Never again...

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** umm...well...no, not really. I think visually the game still looks pretty good, but it's a bit too long and you'll get tired of the industrial optics.

**Should you play it:** the game is now widely available on Steam or GOG (even in Germany) and it's often pretty cheap. For that reason and as a historic artifact it's an easy recommendation, but it's fine to stop anytime you get bored.

{{</ aside >}}

## Half-Life (1998)

Ah yes. The scenic (and seemingly endless) tram ride.

I remember the day when a friend of mine turned up at my place with this game. We installed it, booted it up and I instinctively started moving around with PgUp and PgDown.

"No, no, no, no, no...that's not how you play it." My friend was shocked and amused. "You put your left hand on WASD and use the mouse to look around."

I still remember the awkwardness of trying mouselook for the first time. The sensitivity was way too high, so I was either staring at the ceiling or the floor. At the same time I was turning slowly like a gigantic tanker. My friend chided me a few times when my hands moved back into the comfortable and known arrow keys and CTRL positions.

However, I think after the tram ride (and some messing around in the options menu) I had mostly internalized the controls and there was still enough downtime to learn the ropes.

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** I've played through this game a bunch of times since and I say yes! Visually it hasn't aged well, but the source port still looks pretty good. I haven't played Black Mesa yet, but that's another option.

**Should you play it:** the original Half-Life is still an amazing game. It's not too long and keeps things interesting up until the very end. The only real downside are pacing problems once you enter Xen, the alien homeworld.

{{</ aside >}}

## Quake (1996)

Huh? Oh yeah, I've told you about my first Quake exposure already. So why am I including it here again?

Simple: Quake is still one of the most amazing classic shooters you can play today.

I think for me it clicked after I learned how to use the mouse. I kinda remember beating this game using only the keyboard as well, but it's way less fun. Quake is not meant to be played slow and methodically. You are meant to run and jump around like an absolute maniac, nailing enemies to walls, spinning around and gibbing another horde of 'em with a rocket.

To me, my relationship with the original Quake and Quake II mirrors the one I had with the original Alien movie and Aliens. Way back when I saw those movies first, I enjoyed Aliens much more than the original. I found the original Alien to be very slow and even boring until the splatterfest started. I've since turned around on that and while I still like Aliens, the Xenomorphs in that movie never manage to feel as threatening as the single one in the first movie.

Apart from "I liked two more than one, until I turned around on that", it seems like the comparison falls down a bit. But anyhow, it took me a while until I was ready to appreciate the oppressive atmosphere Quake built up.

Quake is also what made me check out Nine Inch Nails, so...thanks, Quake!

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** yes. Yes, it does. Although every single time I've played it, I remember more running than gunning through the last few levels of episode 4.

**Should you play it:** yes, absolutely. It's also a fairly short game and you can probably get through it in about 4-5h. There are a whole bunch of visual upgrade mods out there and a pretty recently released remastered version.

{{</ aside >}}

## Unreal (1997)

I never finished Unreal.

Make of that what you will. I've come to accept it, even though this sentence kept spinning through my mind late last night when I was lying awake and could not sleep.

I remember the awe-inspiring opening, where you escape the crashed prison ship and find yourself on a strange alien planet. The opening is also very well paced and takes it's time until enemies start showing up. I still remember the first Skaarj encounter, where the player gets trapped and the lights suddenly go dark.

I also remember encountering the peaceful aliens, exploring a pyramid/temple kinda level and then fighting a huge rocket launcher wielding boss in an arena/theater. And then I distinctly remember looking up online roughly where in the walkthrough I was. It was straight in the middle and I was soooooo done with the game.

But it did spawn Unreal Tournament! UT (1998) is still a game I drag back screaming and fighting whenever I manage to get together with a few friends for a gaming session.

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** well...I never finished it, so...probably not. I might have a different opinion now, but I'm wary of starting it again.

**Should you play it:** again...go ask someone else.

{{</ aside >}}

## Resident Evil Remake (2002)

I bought a GameCube just to play this game!

Well...this and RE 4 and RE 0.

I remember one day in school where a friend was talking up Resident Evil 4. He was talking about how you could shoot weapons out of the hands of the Ganados or shoot their legs to make them stumble.

"This one guy was coming at me from a ladder and I kicked down the ladder, but then a chainsaw..."

I mostly heard "DUDE THERE'S A NEW RESIDENT EVIL OUT!!!"

I had totally missed the release of RE 4 and for the next few days I looked up news on the GameCube...and Resident Evil Remake. The screenshots looked amazing.

I was familiar with the original game, having found a copy of it in a used games store. The upside of finding it in that particular store was that the owner didn't care one bit for age verification. He must have sold me the game (sporting a gigantic red *not-for-kids* sticker) when I was 13 or so.

It wasn't long before I borrowed my mom's car and drove to the city to look at a GameCube and the games. And buy them. I must have been 18 to drive, so it was probably 2005, quite a while after the game and the GameCube were released. I could be wrong, but I kinda remember paying 80€ for the console, which I found dirt cheap. With money to spare I was able to buy all three available Resident Evil games: 0, 4 and Remake.

I waded through RE 0 first and convinced myself that I liked it. Even now I catch myself thinking of it that way, but then I remember that I only really love the opening on the train.

I'm not sure if I hit RE 4 or Remake next, but I do remember mild disappointment with RE 4. I did finish it (once only) on the GameCube, but I was alienated by the over-the-shoulder perspective and the increased focus on action over horror.

Resident Evil Remake however was perfect. And it still is. The game felt absolutely familiar and at the same time was a completely new experience. The layout of the mansion was recognizably the same, but it had been expanded with new rooms and even a new outdoors section that had me scared shitless.

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** YES! It's been remastered (not remade again) and in my opinion still looks amazing, especially for a more than twenty year old game.

**Should you play it:** I say yes. And don't chicken out because you can't handle tank controls. Stick with it, because this is still one of the best and most scary survival horror experiences you can get.

{{</ aside >}}

## Hitman: Codename 47 (2000)

I remember a bus ride in 98 or 99, where friends from school were talking about a game called "Commandos".

"Then you take down the Nazi with a knife. But be sure to drag the body behind a house, so nobody can see him."

While I curiously listened, a mental image of the game formed in my head. I was incredibly disappointed, when I later learned that Commandos was a top down tactical strategy game. I had imagined myself in 3rd person (or possibly even 1st person) taking down the guys and frantically hiding bodies.

Luckily, some people were working on exactly that kind of game.

I first saw Hitman: Codename 47 in a PC magazine. I think it was a preview of the game, but they described the first few missions. One where you take out a Yakuza to steal his amulet and another where you snipe some targets in a public park.

I was absolutely thrilled and couldn't wait to get my hands on this game. The first Hitman is a notoriously difficult game and I remember cheesing some missions, especially the later one with a tanker, where I found out that there's just enough time to follow patrols through gates.

I've replayed this game a bunch of times and even though I know the levels inside out, I always run into the same difficulty spikes.

First the complex mission where you have to take out the Blue Lotus leader (I think). It's the one with the jade dragon and American spy you need to rescue. People who've played this game will know what I mean.

Next up is the Scarface drug lord. This mission is incredibly tough and at a certain point everybody will simply detect you instantly and hate you.

And of course the tanker and the final mission in the asylum.

But this game also has one of my all-time favorite missions, which is the Budapest hotel. It's been remade for Hitman 3 and I'd have to replay both versions to be sure, but I think the original is just a tiny bit better. Too bad it's hidden behind the drug lord, meaning a lot of people will not have gotten to play it.

I remember being really disappointed with Hitman 2 when it came out, due to the _make your way to the target_ missions. Especially the one's in Japan were excruciating. Thankfully they got rid of them in the later games.

{{< aside >}}

**Does it hold up:** there was a time and place for Hitman: Codename 47...but it has passed. Later titles come with tons of quality of life improvements and going back to this first installment, especially after having played the new Hitman trilogy, is really hard. There's also not much room for player expression (with the Budapest Hotel being a welcome exception). Twenty years later I play all the missions pretty much exactly the same way I beat them first.

**Should you play it:** I hold tons of nostalgia for the game, but with the high level of difficulty and missing a lot of the quality of life improvements of later games, I cannot recommend this in good conscience.

{{</ aside >}}

## Conclusion

Writing this was a fun trip down memory lane. I'm amazed at how disgusted I was with violence when I was first confronted with it. But that very same afternoon planted a seed in me. I got fascinated with violence in videogames and movies.

To this day, I'm an absolutely non-violent person. I've never held a gun, never even been in a fight. But I had a time where I was actively seeking out violence in media. In games it was thrilling and _forbidden_. Sometimes even funny.

And then again, even though I've been pushing the boundaries of good taste, there are still movies that will shock me. Especially modern horror movies have reached a ruthlessness and brutality that is too much even for me. I'm mainly talking about bones breaking and sticking out of bodies.

Not really sure where this is going... I think ultimatelty I'm proud that my affection for violence hasn't made me a worse or even much different person.

However -- and I'm not sure if that's the dad in me talking or I just got old -- I feel like there's a difference between watching Robocop and playing Quake to watching Saw and playing Dead Island 2.

There's a time and place for violence. You can build up a tolerance for a certain amount of brutality and you can push that limit, as I did.

But I'm not entirely sure that violence in media is harmless. I was always able to tell fiction from reality, but as graphics are getting better and better and devs keep pushing against boundaries, these lines will begin to blur.

What I'm getting at is: playing Quake, Resident Evil or Hitman as a twelve year old was okay, whereas I'd be pretty reluctant to let my kids play anothing that has a German mature rating nowadays.

Thanks for reading.
