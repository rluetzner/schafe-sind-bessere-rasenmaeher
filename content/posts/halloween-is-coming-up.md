## Preamble

Every few years when halloween approaches I get the urge to (re)watch a whole bunch of scary movies. I'm not really picky so anything goes: slashers, elevated horror, ghost flicks, cosmic horror, ...

This year started out with a weird urge to rewatch all the Friday the 13th movies. I looked up the entire franchise and couldn't remember if I had seen the latest reboot. I'm honestly still not quite sure, but I thiiiiink I've seen it once before, so this marks my second go through all of these horrible movies. Sorry for spoiling my opinion beforehand. ðŸ˜œ

I started out pretty early (in the middle of September), so I had more than enough time to finish all these movies. Actually I had time enough to watch the entire Scream franchise as well, where I definately hadn't seen anything beyond the third installment. I then moved on to Halloween, of which it turned out I had seen more movies than I'd expected, but discovered the amazing 2018 reboot.

I also started watching Ash vs. Evil Dead again, but have taken a short break after the first season (for now).

Here are short opinions on all of these movies and the tv show. There'll probably be **spoilers** for a few movie bits, so be prepared. I'll try to hide spoilers for newer movies behind a drop down.

## Friday the 13th franchise

### Friday the 13th (1980)

I honestly never liked this movie. I wanted to like it, because some of my school friends were really into it, but even the first time I saw it I was bored out of my mind.

I have no idea how this movie spawned a franchise with **12 movies**.

### Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)

Very boring. There is no real tension as it is always obvious who is going to get killed when. Jason basically enters a room and without stalking or terrifying his victim just quickly disposes of one of the increadibly horny teens. And in between these kill scenes everybody is just so damn happy.

The ending builds a little bit of tension, but even then the terror hardly has any room to breathe.

### Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982)

Even though this movie has the lowest score on [rottentomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/friday_the_13th) so far, I found this somewhat entertaining.

This is the movie where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask and has some creative, funny and entertaining kills. It's a fun watch, but not scary whatsoever.

### Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)

Nope. This franchise is far from over. It's hilarious how the fourth movie is called _The Final Chapter_, when another movie was released the next year.

If I remember correctly, this movie is actually entertaining and at least somewhat scary. At least in the sense, that some tension is allowed to build up.

I also noticed that they kept any damage to the mask from the prior movie. This trend goes on for quite some time, which I leveraged to get me at least a little hyped in between movies. I find it important that the rules and world are kept consistent between movies, at least as long as the main character/villain doesn't change.

### Friday the 13th -- A New Beginning (1985)

This movie has lots of promise, but is undercut by a very forced and misguided attempt at humor. The general idea is good and terrifying and is pretty similar to what Halloween 4 tried to set up with it's ending.

As with Halloween, the twist ending is completely undercut and retconned in the next movie.

### Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986)

Now, this is **amazing**! Right from the beginning, where Tommy accidentally revives Jason by stabbing him with a bar from the graveyard fence in wild rage, which is then hit by lightning, this movie tells you that it's going to be a wild ride. And it is. This might also explain why I'm not bothered by everyone being so horny (including Tommy who saw his friend be killed by a resurrected Jason just a few hours ago).

This is a movie that I can absolutely recommend, because it is just absolutely bonkers and doesn't take itself seriously.

### Friday the 13th Part VII -- The New Blood (1988)

And this is where the blow it again. On the one hand it has a telekinetic protagonist, who uses her powers to fight against Jason, but on the other hand it's again too serious. This could have done with some of Part VI's over-the-top-ness.

### Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989)

Here are some quotes from other viewers on [rottentomatoes}(https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friday_the_13th_part_8_jason_takes_manhattan):

> After over one hour, Jason finally arrives in Manhattan but doesn't take shit, only making this another dull and miserably awful sequel that feels like an eternity, with uninspired deaths, a bizarrely schizophrenic protagonist and a ludicrous plot even worse than the last.

> This movie's 'title' should've been: Jason Takes Manhattan, But It Takes Him Over An Hour To Get There By Ship. Talk about a misleading title. And when Jason does indeed get to Manhattan, he still focuses on the same group of people he's been trying to kill on the ship, it's just that they manage to row a lifeboat there.

This movie is really incoherent and weird. Manhattan does not factor into the plot **at all** and could just as well have been any place else.

Letting Jason loose in Manhattan leads to some mildly funny encounters with people that obviously have no clue who he is, but I don't think these are worth watching the movie for.

### Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993)

Never say never again. We still have 3 movies to go after this one. ðŸ¤®

The movie starts out okay, with an amazing fake-out in which the FBI blows Jason apart by using one of their female agents as bait.

Then a coroner is overcome with the urge to eat Jason's still beating heart and suddenly we have a body-swapping Jason. This could lead to some tense situations where it's unclear who's body Jason is inhabiting, but it's never really a question.

The only thing worth mentioning are the little references to other franchises, like the Necronomicon lying around in the Voorhees' house and of course Freddy Krueger's glove grabbing Jason's mask at the very end.

### Jason X (2002)

This. Is. Bonkers. In the best way possible.

The movie probably deserves it's low rating, but it is pretty funny.

The premise is that Jason is kept in cold storage for 400 years, wakes up on a space ship and starts murdering the crew.

There's an android reprogramming herself to be a kill-bot, Jason gets med-bay'ed into a Super-Jason and multiple space ships are destroyed, not to mention an entire squad of space marines is wiped out. What's not to like? ðŸ˜…

### Freddy vs. Jason (2003)

I remember hating this movie when I first saw it. While rewatching it now, I was very surprised at how intricate the plot is. There are multiple layers in which stuff is happening.

There's Freddy coaxing Jason into murdering Teens on Elm Street, a suspicious mental hospital, a dad drugging his daughter without her knowing it, ... That doesn't make this an art film, but it keeps things moving and the movie is actually well paced. This is also the first movie where I find the actors mostly convincing.

### Friday the 13th (2009)

This is a very gritty take on Jason, mostly undercut by a cast of unlikeable characters to get killed off.

The main protagonist is pretty okay, but there's a bunch of people renting a hut near crystal lake which are embarrassing to watch.

The violence and gore in this movie are also turned up to eleven, making this sometimes hard to watch, but that is simply related to when this movie came out. After Saw everything had to become more brutal to keep up and provoke an audience reaction. Including myself, although I don't really like how numb I've become in that department.

## Scream franchise

### Scream (1996)
