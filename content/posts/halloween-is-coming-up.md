## Preamble

Every few years when halloween approaches I get the urge to (re)watch a whole bunch of scary movies. I'm not really picky so anything goes: slashers, elevated horror, ghost flicks, cosmic horror, ...

This year started out with a weird urge to rewatch all the _Friday the 13th_ movies. I looked up the entire franchise and couldn't remember if I had seen the latest reboot. I'm honestly still not quite sure, but I thiiiiink I've seen it once before, so this marks my second go through all of these horrible movies. Sorry for spoiling my opinion beforehand. ðŸ˜œ

I started out pretty early (in the middle of September), so I had more than enough time to finish all these movies. Actually I had time enough to watch the entire _Scream_ franchise as well, where I definately hadn't seen anything beyond the third installment. I then moved on to _Halloween_, of which it turned out I had seen more movies than I'd expected, but discovered the amazing 2018 reboot.

I also started watching _Ash vs. Evil Dead_ again, but have taken a short break after the first season (for now).

Here are short opinions on all of these movies and the tv show. There'll probably be **spoilers** for a few movie bits, so be prepared. I'll try to hide spoilers for newer movies behind a drop down.

## Friday the 13th franchise

### Friday the 13th (1980)

I honestly never liked this movie. I wanted to like it, because some of my school friends were really into it, but even the first time I saw it I was bored out of my mind.

I have no idea how this movie spawned a franchise with **12 movies**.

### Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)

Very boring. There is no real tension as it is always obvious who is going to get killed when. Jason basically enters a room and without stalking or terrifying his victim just quickly disposes of one of the increadibly horny teens. And in between these kill scenes everybody is just so damn happy.

The ending builds a little bit of tension, but even then the terror hardly has any room to breathe.

### Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982)

Even though this movie has the lowest score on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/friday_the_13th) so far, I found this somewhat entertaining.

This is the movie where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask and has some creative, funny and entertaining kills. It's a fun watch, but not scary whatsoever.

### Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)

Nope. This franchise is far from over. It's hilarious how the fourth movie is called _The Final Chapter_, when another movie was released the next year.

If I remember correctly, this movie is actually entertaining and at least somewhat scary. At least in the sense, that some tension is allowed to build up.

I also noticed that they kept any damage to the mask from the prior movie. This trend goes on for quite some time, which I leveraged to get me at least a little hyped in between movies. I find it important that the rules and world are kept consistent between movies, at least as long as the main character/villain doesn't change.

### Friday the 13th -- A New Beginning (1985)

This movie has lots of promise, but is undercut by a very forced and misguided attempt at humor. The general idea is good and terrifying and is pretty similar to what _Halloween 4_ tried to set up with it's ending.

As with _Halloween_, the twist ending is completely undercut and retconned in the next movie.

### Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986)

Now, this is **amazing**! Right from the beginning, where Tommy accidentally revives Jason by stabbing him with a bar from the graveyard fence in wild rage, which is then hit by lightning, this movie tells you that it's going to be a wild ride. And it is. This might also explain why I'm not bothered by everyone being so horny (including Tommy who saw his friend be killed by a resurrected Jason just a few hours ago).

This is a movie that I can absolutely recommend, because it is just absolutely bonkers and doesn't take itself seriously.

### Friday the 13th Part VII -- The New Blood (1988)

And this is where the blow it again. On the one hand it has a telekinetic protagonist, who uses her powers to fight against Jason, but on the other hand it's again too serious. This could have done with some of Part VI's over-the-top-ness.

### Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989)

Here are some quotes from other viewers on [Rotten Tomatoes}(https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friday_the_13th_part_8_jason_takes_manhattan):

> After over one hour, Jason finally arrives in Manhattan but doesn't take shit, only making this another dull and miserably awful sequel that feels like an eternity, with uninspired deaths, a bizarrely schizophrenic protagonist and a ludicrous plot even worse than the last.

> This movie's 'title' should've been: Jason Takes Manhattan, But It Takes Him Over An Hour To Get There By Ship. Talk about a misleading title. And when Jason does indeed get to Manhattan, he still focuses on the same group of people he's been trying to kill on the ship, it's just that they manage to row a lifeboat there.

This movie is really incoherent and weird. Manhattan does not factor into the plot **at all** and could just as well have been any place else.

Letting Jason loose in Manhattan leads to some mildly funny encounters with people that obviously have no clue who he is, but I don't think these are worth watching the movie for.

### Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993)

Never say never again. We still have 3 movies to go after this one. ðŸ¤®

The movie starts out okay, with an amazing fake-out in which the FBI blows Jason apart by using one of their female agents as bait.

Then a coroner is overcome with the urge to eat Jason's still beating heart and suddenly we have a body-swapping Jason. This could lead to some tense situations where it's unclear who's body Jason is inhabiting, but it's never really a question.

The only thing worth mentioning are the little references to other franchises, like the Necronomicon lying around in the Voorhees' house and of course Freddy Krueger's glove grabbing Jason's mask at the very end.

### Jason X (2002)

This. Is. Bonkers. In the best way possible.

The movie probably deserves it's low rating, but it is pretty funny.

The premise is that Jason is kept in cold storage for 400 years, wakes up on a space ship and starts murdering the crew.

There's an android reprogramming herself to be a kill-bot, Jason gets med-bay'ed into a Super-Jason and multiple space ships are destroyed, not to mention an entire squad of space marines is wiped out. What's not to like? ðŸ˜…

### Freddy vs. Jason (2003)

I remember hating this movie when I first saw it. While rewatching it now, I was very surprised at how intricate the plot is. There are multiple layers in which stuff is happening.

There's Freddy coaxing Jason into murdering Teens on Elm Street, a suspicious mental hospital, a dad drugging his daughter without her knowing it, ... That doesn't make this an art film, but it keeps things moving and the movie is actually well paced. This is also the first movie where I find the actors mostly convincing.

### Friday the 13th (2009)

This is a very gritty take on Jason, mostly undercut by a cast of unlikeable characters to get killed off.

The main protagonist is pretty okay, but there's a bunch of people renting a hut near crystal lake which are embarrassing to watch.

The violence and gore in this movie are also turned up to eleven, making this sometimes hard to watch, but that is simply related to when this movie came out. After Saw everything had to become more brutal to keep up and provoke an audience reaction. Including myself, although I don't really like how numb I've become in that department.

## Scream franchise

### Scream (1996)

For reasons I'm not quite able to explain today, I disliked this movie when I watched it for the first time. The absence of a supernatural killer somehow broke it for me.

Today I think this is a really cleverly written meta-slasher. Although it has some jump scares, I don't think this is a frightening movie. It's still very fun to watch and has some nice acting in it.

### Scream II (1997)

A quick follow-up that ranks higher than the original on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/scream) although I don't get why. It's an okay movie, but seeing the events repeated takes away from the meta stuff for me.

It's still enjoyable and not as bad as sequels might get.

### Scream III (2000)

By far the worst Scream movie, although even this has some interesting bits in it, e.g. Sidney getting hunted around the set of _Stab 3_ and having PTSD flashbacks to the events of the first movie. However, any new characters are pretty annoying.

I was surprised to find Patrick Warburton in this movie. I recently finished watching _The Venture Bros._ and immediately recognized his voice. "Hey, this guy sounds like Brock. Could it be?" Yup, it can.

This is also where I was very annoyed by the IMDB trivia stuff. First of all, there's way to many entries and much of them are redundant. Far worse is that (albeit hidden in the Spoiler section) they give away a vital detail of the latest Scream movie. The entry goes something like this:

> Initially the Killer was meant to be XXXXXXXX, an idea that was scrapped for this movie. However in Scream (2022) the Killer really is XXXXXXXX.

I was sooooo annoyed at this, as the movie just came out and I was really looking forward to watching it. I don't see why I should expect Spoilers for a sequel in the trivia section of one of it's predecessors. Much less a movie that was released 22 years earlier.

### Scream 4 (2011)

Pretty much from the get-go, it's clear that this is a much more modern horror movie. The gore is turned way up in comparison to the earlier movies. I've already stated that I'm not in favor, but seeing {{< spoiler >}} broken bones and a disemboweled body (although that might be in the next movie) {{</ spoiler >}} is pretty much the only thing that can make me squeemish now.

The beginning {{< spoiler >}} has a very funny fake-out where they nest multiple _Stab_ movies inside each other, before the actual movie starts. {{</ spoiler >}}

I can't quite remember how surprised I was when they finally revealed who the killer/s is/are. In hindsight it was pretty much obvious and I think I expected it at one point, but the movie might have been intelligent enough to misguide me. ðŸ˜…

### Scream (2022)

I was having high hopes, seeing the rating on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scream_2022) and I wasn't disappointed.

It defines itself as a _requel_, a mixture between a reboot and a sequel, as stated in the meta explanation inside the movie.

There's a new generation of characters being hunted, who are supported by the old survivors. Having this movie state specifically what a _requel_ is and giving _Ghostbusters - Afterlife_ as an example made me put this together for the first time. Actually quite clever to use nostalgia in combination with a newer and younger cast to keep the franchise alive.

It's no surprise that the three musketeers (Sidney, Gale and Dewey) return, but {{< spoiler >}} it's a surprise that Dewey finally takes his last stab. I've been waiting for this for a while now, as it become too predictable over the last four movies and I was waiting for them to break expectations. As so often, this pretty much led me to believe this would happen. I'm still sad to see him go, as I rather liked the character. {{</ spoiler >}}

I started trivia hunting again, because I remember being a bit touched that Courtney Cox (Gale Weathers) and David Arquette (Dewey) got married before _Scream 3_. I discovered this way back as a kid, when I saw the credits for said movie. Now I was shocked (although seeing as it's hollywood and not that uncommon) to see that they were no longer a couple. They still appeared on camera together, both still being in love with each other. I was hunting for any information about their actual real-life relationship, although I didn't find anything and I could probably just have looked this up specifically.

## Halloween

### Halloween (1978)

There's not much to say about this masterpiece. I've seen this movie countless times, although this might have been the first time I've seen it in english. At least I never noticed before how Donald Pleasence doesn't have an indoor voice in this movie. ðŸ˜… In every single scene he's talking just a bit louder than necessary and whatever he says stuff that noone in their right mind would formulate that way, which makes him appear delusional and explains why the Sheriff might be reluctant to help him. I quite liked this touch and it didn't take away from the film.

Additionally this might be the first time that I actually understood (or think I did) why Michael Myers follows Laurie Strode around. He sees her drop off the key to the Myers house, which her father is trying to sell. This puts him in contact and makes him stalk her for the rest of the movie.

### Halloween II (1981)

For whatever reason, the sequel never aired on television. I saw higher entries, most notably 4 and 5, but was always on the lookout for this movie.

I have to say that I was quite surprised how good it was. Even though the side cast is unreasonable horny, the movie manages to stay serious and suspenseful the whole time.

I couldn't remember how they retconned the ending, where Dr. Loomis blows up / burns himself and Michael. But, before I could find out what they did, I had to watch...

### Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)

Urgh. This was a slog. It starts out promising with a cool chase scene and creepy guys, but quickly falls down for me when the protagonist instantly falls in plot love with a girl. He decides to go off on an adventure with her, even though he promised mere minutes ago that he'd take care of his kids over the weekend. Maybe it's because I'm a double dad now, but it made me really dislike the character.

Any non-practical effects look ridiculous and the plot is very confusing and laughable. When they finally reveal the Stonehenge menhir in the underground lab, I thought to myself: "oh yeah, they foreshadowed that about an hour ago and it didn't make a lick of sense."

The villain thinks it's the ultimate prank to kill a whole bunch of young kids all over the U.S.A. I'm still unsure if this is really creepy or incredibly stupid and unimaginative.

Probably the best thing is that the movie has a really dark cliffhanger ending that cuts away at just the right moment.

### Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)

He's back (baby)! I think this might have been the first movie I saw when I was a kid. Either this or _Halloween 6_, both of which ran on TV almost every year around Halloween, instead of the first two better movies.

This one's actually pretty okay. Michael is hunting his niece, the daughter of Laurie Strode who died. I initially thought that they retconned the plot for _Halloween - H20_, which led me to a deep-dive article explaining which _Halloween_ movies belong to which timeline.

Aaaaaanyway...Michael and Dr. Loomis were heavily burned after the events in _Halloween II_, but both survived. Donald Pleasence gets to show off his burned face, which they get rid of immediately in the next movie. They're saying he had reconstructive surgery, but what they're actually saying is: "we didn't have enough budget for the mask."

I can't remember too much else about this movie, but the ending is absolutely amazing. Donald Pleasence looks shocked and close to breaking when he sees Jamie (the little girl) holding bloody scissors after stabbing her mom. But then...

### Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)

No idea what _new_ kind of _revenge_ he's taking here. Michael Myers is once again roaming free. They immediately retcon the amazing ending of the fourth movie (which mirrors what Friday the 13th Part VI did as well, but a few years earlier) by saying that Jamie only wounded her mom. She's now in some kind of mental hospital, but receives regular visits from her family.

She has stopped talking, which is not really important for the plot. For whatever reason she also has a psychic connection to Michael and witnesses all his kills.

Donald Pleasence is really unpleasant here. His obsession with Michael leads to a few scenes where he's pressuring Jamie into using her psychic connection and makes him seem like an absolut monster. Dr. Loomis was always a bit unhinged and obsessive, but he's mostly able to empathize. I have no idea why they thought this might be a good idea.

### Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers

Ah yes. The **cult** movie. Not as in _it has a cult following_, but rather _suddenly there is a cult semi-controlling Michael Myers_.

This ends the Jamie trilogy with her having a baby and fleeing a cult facility. Michael tracks her down and kills her, but is later recovered by Tommy (the little kid that Laurie babysits in the first movie -- excellent callback and well acted by Paul Rudd). Michael is out to kill his family and the cult is in favor, because of reasons I've already forgotten again.

This is one of the movies I saw as a kid, most likely the first _Halloween_ I ever saw on TV. This however marks the first time I've watched _the Producer's cut_. I only realized this later when I was astonished that I could not remember the confusing ending where Dr. Loomis is elected as the next gatekeeper of the cult. This is such a weird cliffhanger, especially seeing as this was Donald Pleasence's last movie and we never get to see what the ending entails.

### Halloween H20: 20 years later

This marks the first return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the _Halloween_ franchise. Despite there not being any major surprises and any deviation from the generic _Halloween_ formula, I still like this movie. For whatever reason (and I don't think I'm alone here) I like following up on Laurie's story the most interesting part of the _Halloween_ franchise.

I still remembered the shocking ending, where Laurie chops off Michaels head with a fire axe and was looking forward to how the next movie might retcon this. Looking forward to the next movie was a mistake however...

### Halloween: Resurrection

Oh boy. I mean...they figured out a very easy way out of the _chopped-off-head_ pickle, but the retcon makes the ending of the previous movie so much less satisfying. I was hoping for something a bit cooler, however I have no idea what that might have been. Maybe just shutdown the franchise.

Anyway, Laurie is back, but she's killed of in the first few minutes. The rest of the movie follows a bunch of college students that participate in a live-streamed haunted house experience in the Myers' house. The pre-scripted events start to mingle with the actual Michael Myers killing off people. They try to do something interesting with the headcam perspective, but it doesn't end up working. Instead it leads to a hillarious scene where the secret chat-boyfriend of our main protagonist streams the event at a party and gradually manages to drag all party people off to watch the stream. Of course the nerd manages to safe the day, but the brightly lit and happy party atmosphere clashes strongly with the gritty haunted house vibe of the rest of the movie.

It also has Busta Rhymes in it, who's character is entirely unlikeable, although he thinks he's the coolest. Also...not a great actor.

### Halloween (2007) + Halloween II (2009)

The Rob Zombie remake / reimagining of Michael Myers' origin story. I really want to like this movie and it's sequel, but I find them very hard to watch.

On the plus side, they are well shot and directed and take the story in an interesting alternative direction. Both movies try to get the audience to empathize with Michael, but they sacrifice the heroes instead. The main protagonists Laurie and Dr. Loomis are portrayed very differently here. I tried to approach this with an open mind, but I like Laurie and Loomis as characters too much to be able to handle this. Especially Loomis is shown as being an arrogant and egotistical ass. He gets a redemption moment at the very end of the second movie, but it's forced and doesn't really save him from my condemnation.

What also makes these movies hard to watch is the insane amount of swearing. It feels like almost all sentences have an F-bomb in them, but instead of making this more _hardcore_ and gritty, I find that it takes me out of the story every few minutes. The violence is also turned up with some horrifying kills that are just a bit too realistic to be enjoyable. Maybe the movies are meant to make me queasy, but wheras I can see myself watching _Schindler's list_ again, I'll probably steer away from these two movies in the future.

### Halloween (2018)

And now this. The movie I've been waiting for, because I hadn't seen it yet and in fact hadn't even realized that a new _Halloween_ movie had been released. Even more: there was this, a sequel and a third movie set to be released just a few days later.

This movie is straight up amazing. I'd have to watch it again to try and figure out exactly why it hooked me more than the Rob Zombie remake. From what I remember, I think at least part of it is Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as a paranoid, reclusive grandmother who cares deeply for her family, but can't be a part of them. The movie (trilogy) also takes care to keep the legacy of Michael Myers alive by never actually showing him without his mask. Any time he's in the scene he has this dominating presence.

Other than the Rob Zombie movies the kills here didn't really make me queasy. The movie is still pushing the pedal on violence and gore, but the kills are imaginative and had me chuckling more often than not.

The ending is also spot on and having seen the next two movies, I would much rather have preferred this being the final page in _Halloween_'s book.

### Halloween Kills (2021)

This is a weird movie. It starts out strong and I rather like how they managed to get out of the ending dillema of the last movie. After that the pacing is just off. Laurie is stuck in a hospital for most of the movie and doesn't actually get to do anything. There's a pack of vigilantes out to get Michael Myers, which we've already seen before in _Halloween 4_.

It has some interesting ideas, the strongest of them being a repeat of what happened the last time vigilantes were out to take out Michael Myers. Michael shows up again late in the movie and

{{< spoiler >}}
escapes from an absolutely impossible situation. There are multiple guns pointed at him and an angry mob is trying to lynch him, but he just takes out a whole army of vigilantes. And then comes back to kill Laurie's daughter, although the movie tries to establish that he's not actually after Laurie at all.
{{</ spoiler >}}

### Halloween Ends (2022)

I was really looking forward to this as an epic final battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Sadly, this is not that movie. Instead it's like two mismatched movies sown together by someone who's not particulary good at sewing.

Laurie's granddaughter falls in helpless plot-love with a guy that has a dark past, but is actually a good guy. Until 

{{< spoiler >}}
he meets Michael Myers and looks into his eyes. Without really having established any dark tendencies (I don't count the accident from the beginning), the Big-Bang-Theory-Lennard-lookalike starts taking out people that bug him or his girlfriend/Laurie's granddaughter.

Most of the movie revolves around this plot. The only cool setpiece of this is a double-kill setup where Michael comes in as a surprise killer to help out BBT-Lennard (I forgot the actual name of the character).

Laurie does get to finish of Michael, but the ending is neither epic nor climactic in any way. It's a sad and pathetic ending for someone who has endured countless retconned deaths over the years. The ending of the movie left me feeling a bit like a deflated balloon. While I can easily see myself rewatching _Halloween (2018)_ and might in fact make it my default sequel to _Halloween (1978)_, I'll probably never watch _Kills_ and _Ends_ again.
{{</ spoiler >}}

## Ash vs. Evil Dead

### Season 01

I saw this when it first came out and followed it regularly on Amazon. One of the few series (apart from _The Expanse_) where I was waiting every week for a new episode to come out, just like in the olden days.

I can't say quite how this happened, but I did forget how crazy fun this is. Almost all of the episodes are a breezy 23-25 minutes and are filled with hillariously incorrect, but still funny jokes and oneliners. This is the perfect continuation of _Evil Dead II_ and _Army of Darkness_.

I just fear that the humour falls down sometime in the next two seasons and that's where my bad memories from this series come from. However, the first season is absolutely amazing. Pablo and Kelly are great sidekicks and characters in their own right. Having honduran Pablo next to the racially, politically and generally insensitive character of Ash leads to some of the best jokes. I can appriciate them that much more, because I know that Ash is not really racist, but just an absolute dumbass that gets lucky most of the time. "Shoot first, think never!" ðŸ¤£
