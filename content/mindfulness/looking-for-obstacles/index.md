It's been a while since I've published anything on this site. Every now and then an idea pops into my head that sparks a flame of excitement. Sadly these don't last long enough for me to sit down and actually write them out.

I have tons of ideas in my notes, but the excitement often leaves me once I've written down a few words as a reminder.

Part of it is, that so many of these things have been said before, often by people that are much better wordsmiths than I am. But another big part of it is that I'm really exhausted.

For a while sitting down to blog was a way to replenish my energy. I assume this would come back with a bit of practice and regularity.

But right now I feel like doing other things.

I was about to delete this post again, but I had a quick look at my blog ideas and discovered something interesting.

> finding a way vs. Finding obstacles

This was one of the ideas that I woke up with one morning and decided it would be interesting to think through.

## At work

I noticed that when I'm in _at work_ mode, I rarely get discouraged by things that get in my way. I write software for a living and while there are certain hard limits, you can usually achieve whatever you want if you try long and hard enough.

I'm usually the one to pick tasks that nobody else wants. I don't care if I have to bang my head against a wall for a few hours or days, because I usually learn something interesting from it. I'm a Jack of all trades and I don't mind being a master of none, because I like learning about and discovering new things.

And I'm good at it. It took me years to figure that out and even longer to be able to say it out loud. I am a good multi-tool.

## At home

However, when I'm not at work, I tend to put everything off until the very last minute. Instead of plunging head first into action, I actively seek out any obstacles, no matter how small, to keep me from getting into gear.

It took me **over a year** to finally mount a board on the kitchen wall.

And that was purely the act of mounting it, we had the board and screws and all the other parts necessary.

_"Aaaaah...you know I have to drill holes in the wall, so I can't do it after work. It'll be too late and annoy the neighbours."_

_"Well I can't do it this weekend, obviously. We already have other plans and besides I'm exhausted from working all week."_

_"Yeah, I know I've been on vacation for a while now, but I still need to drill the holes and you know the kids don't like loud noise and the weather outside and..."_

## Why? Where does this come from?

> Robert at home: _"Aaaaah, it'll have to wait until tomorrow."_

Seeing it like that, it's really bugging me. Where does this come from? Why do I act so differently?

**It's not that I think things are hard.** Drilling holes and putting up boards is super easy. It **did** take longer than the 5 minutes I expected, but it still was finished very quickly.

**It's also not that things are less rewardning.** If anything, getting shit done at work can feel much less rewarding. I often put in loads of effort to get things done quickly, just to see them float around unused for months. In contrast to that, I felt an immediate sense of accomplishment once the board was up and I see it every day and smile a little.

**Maybe it's having a deadline?** I don't know. Setting arbitrary deadlines in my private life feels...wrong somehow. And as I mentioned just now, having a deadline at work can be utterly meaningless, if the new feature remains unused for months.

**I don't think it's exhaustion**, because I feel exhausted no matter if I am at work or not.

**Might be the people depending on me**, although I'm a bit unhappy with the idea. I'm quick to say _yes_ and I rarely say _no_ to requests. There is a chance that I just don't want to disappoint people. But then again, my wife asked me to mount the board in the kitchen and I had no problem letting that slip for a year. We're getting into dangerous thoughts territory here. She _should_ be the person I want to disappoint the least (other than my kids), but I might have tempered her expectations a bit already. **Am I okay with putting my wife on hold?**

Or maybe it's much simpler. **I love tinkering with software and code, but I'm not a good handyman.** Also some flaws there, because I also like writing and I haven't written in two months. I also enjoyed practicing Taiji, but stopped almost three years ago and at least for the moment I have no intentions of picking it back up again.

I don't think I'm going to solve this and I actually don't even think that this is something that needs to be solved.

The important thing is that any boards that need mounting get mounted eventually.
