I am constantly afraid of missing something.

I've talked about media consumption before, but another part of my unhealthy relationship with it, is that I'm constantly afraid of missing out.

New movies, TV shows and games come out all the time and even if you limit them by things that interest me and those that are liked by critics and the audience/players, there's still too much to see it all.

I'm still hung up on _Elden Ring_, because it's supposed to be the pinnacle of From's Souls games. The DLC _Shadow of the Erdtree_ was released semi-recently and it would **double** the already hefty playing time.

I simply don't know when I could possibly finish it.

Instead of pushing on, I instead switched gears and turned towards older games.

Sometimes a random game will pop into my head and I'll get the strong urge to play it. It happened recently with _X-Men: Origins - Wolverine_, _Wheelman_ and the _Blackwell_ series. All games I've played before.

I used to suppress these urges, because playing something old would mean that I'm not spending time on something **new**.

This time however, I tried to change my paradigm slightly with a "why the hell not?"
