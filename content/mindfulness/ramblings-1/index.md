I'm not the first person to notice this, nor am I the first person to write about it, but **not everything that is meant to help you relax is healthy**. And I'm not even talking about drugs, but rather movies, TV shows or video games.

I'm a big fan of all these things and there's nothing wrong with spending a relaxed evening in front of the TV. I'd go as far as to say there's nothing particularly wrong with spending a whole week with a captivating video game.

Addiction is surely a big problem, but that's not what I want to talk about. At least that's not what's giving me trouble.

Instead, I eventually fall into the rhythm of treating things as checkbox items. Something that needs to be cleared off of a list. My fun free time activities become -- more work!

_"I loved Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul has been out for years now and I still haven't started season 2 yet."_

_"Depending on the day you ask me, I'd say that Dark Souls is my favorite video game. I've been with the series since the original Demon's Souls -- but I still haven't beaten Elden Ring."_

These kind of thoughts often go through my head. Especially in the evenings, when the flat finally quiets down, all the household chores are done and I'm finally free to -- _get to work!_

But which item should I check off the list? An episode of _Better Call Saul_ is about 50 minutes. That's just slightly too long for two episodes in a row, but I also don't want to do two things.

I could pick up where I left off in _Elden Ring_, but firing that up for just an hour and a half feels like a waste of time. I'll just be wandering around senselessly, getting killed every now and then. And what the fuck was I doing three weeks ago anyway!?

I'm suffering from choice paralysis, but also stress and anxiety because I feel like I'm lagging behind. When I eventually decide on something I want to pursue, I try to do as much as possible and end up going to bed too late. My kids show no mercy and **will** wake me up no matter if I've slept 7, 8 or 5 hours.

Nevertheless, when anybody asks me what I want more of, I answer "me time!" And what I mean with that is: "I want to game! I want to just sit down and watch a show! I haven't watched a movie from start to finish in ages!"

Reading through _Reconciliation: Healing the inner child_ by Thich Nhat Hanh I felt the small tingling of an epiphany. I think my mind and body are indeed trying to tell me something. I really do want more _me time_, but it's perfectly fine to reject things that cause me stress in my free time.

What I should be doing instead is **pause**.

And I've actually already done a few healthy adjustments, even before I started reading the book.

_Better Call Saul_ still pops up on my "Up next" list in Jellyfin, but it's now next to the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ Nickelodeon series from 2012. I loved that show and never finished it. Episodes are just 20 minutes and usually pretty fun, self-contained and fast paced. I can start and stop whenever I want.

I've abandoned the idea of finishing _Elden Ring_ anytime soon, but I've been enjoying _Mario's Picross_ instead lately. I'm playing that for the first time. I also went back and finally finished _Metroid Prime_ as well as started replaying the _Blackwell_ point and click adventures. I'm currently stuck in _Blackwell Convergence_, part three of a series of five games. They're good!

In both cases I'm enjoying something nostalgic. Retro games or a show that I've watched about a decade ago. I'm not exactly sure what drew me to them, but I do feel that they are healthier in that I don't feel "bad" when I'm not playing the games or watching the show. I'm not _missing_ anything.

This is of course not the same as actually sitting down for a few minutes and taming my rampant thoughts with proper meditation, **but**(!!!) these steps actually freed me up enough to get other things in that I enjoy more.

Like writing this blog post. Or, you know...sitting down and meditating. I think it's time to pick this up again.
