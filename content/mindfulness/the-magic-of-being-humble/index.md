I've had a low-level fascination with knots since I was a little kid. Now, ever since I learned the [Ian Knot](../tying-shoelaces), I've been meaning to look into more knots and try and learn them. I got it in my head today to build new bows for my kids, so of course I first wanted to learn how to tie a knot for a bowstring.

I'm not even sure if I found the right thing, but I stumbled upon the [Bowline Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot). I found a guide on https://www.animatedknots.com and pretty much got stuck on the site for the rest of the day.

I've now learned four new knots, each with a specific field of application.

1. The [Bowline Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot) mentioned above, for when I want a fixed loop at the end of a rope.
2. The [Running Bowline Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/running-bowline-knot) for when I want a noose. I knew a simple [Slip Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/slip-knot) before and that's probably okay for most situations, but this one's a bit more robust.
3. The [Alpine Butterfly Loop](https://www.animatedknots.com/alpine-butterfly-loop-knot) for when both ends of a rope are tied down, but I still need a loop in the middle. The knot is super robust and allows pulling on both ends without slipping. I also watched the animation once, tried it in slow motion and remembered it right away.
4. The [Double Fishermen's Bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot) for when I want to tie two ropes together. It's meant for ropes of similar size. I found another knot for ropes with very different sizes, but I think I'm more likely to deal with similar ropes.

I'm not a climber.

I haven't been camping in years.

I've been on boats, but never in control and never without professionals.

I'm not a doomsday prepper (although what better time than now to become one?!).

So why would I need to know knots?

I haven't entirely been able to answer that, but at least part of it is, that I wanted my grandpa to teach me some useful knots.

In [absence of my dad](../a-blast-from-the-past/), my grandpa (on my mother's side) slipped into the role of surrogate father.

I loved my grandpa. While my grandma was very strict, whenever we were alone, he'd be down for the silliest things.

I remember one occasion where we were on the empty parking space of a local supermarket. It must have been Sunday or some kind of holiday and I think we were there because he was trying to teach me how to ride a bike.

Anyway, the supermarket sold all kinds of stuff, even down to outdoor equipment, so in the middle of this huge parking space was a fenced off area with ladders standing upright. I convinced my grandpa to let me climb the tallest ladder.

While I was up on the top and my grandpa was gripping onto the ladder through the fence for dear life, I saw a cop car appear around the corner. I climbed down as quickly as I could, but of course they had seen me.

Despite the scolding he got and being afraid for his grandkid (who wouldn't fucking listen and come down, but instead climbed higher and higer), I can't remember him blaming me for it or getting angry. He must have been scared and angry like crazy and I'm impressed that he managed to keep that to himself.

My grandpa, to me, was always a rock. Strong and tall, but always kind-hearted, cheery and warm. I looked up to him, both literally and figuratively.

One of my earliest memories is him stopping a tank(!).

This was at a time where American soldiers were still stationed in Germany and for whatever reason they were moving that thing around.

My grandpa managed to flag them down. I'm not sure how they communicated, because, having immigrated from Hungary in the 70s, he didn't know a lick of English and barely any German. But somehow he managed to convince the soldiers to show me the tank from the inside.

The more I write, the more memories come up. It's kinda hard to put them aside, but I wanted to talk about two specific stories I remember about my grandpa.

----

When I was 11 or 12, I learned the basics of chess. It wasn't my grandpa who taught me, but one of my friends. It was sadly somebody I saw pretty rarely, so I went large stretches without chess. When I asked my mom for a chess computer, she replied "Why don't you play against Grandpa? He knows chess."

So I did.

For a while, we'd play every chance we got.

At one of these occasions, my grandparents had friends over.

"So you like chess?", the guy said. I can't remember his name or how they knew my grandparents. "Has he told you the story how he beat a chess master?"

I looked at my grandpa, but he looked away in embarrassment.

As it turns out, one day back in Hungary, my grandpa noticed a chess master in the local park. He watched him play for a bit, until he made up his mind to approach him. He didn't mention that he recognized him or that he could play chess. He rather said something to the likes of _"this looks interesting, can you teach me?"_

So he kinda tricked the guy into "teaching" him chess and while he was preoccupied, my grandpa somehow managed to outmaneuver him.

_"How do you form a fist?"_

This question came up at a Taiji retreat, while we were discussing one of the stances.

I knew exactly what my teacher was going for. _"You put the thumb on the outside. If you grip the thumb with the other fingers, you'll break your thumb on impact."_

As always with Taiji, I was the youngest person in the room. I remember the others staring at me. My best guess is that until then I had shown absolutely no signs of a violent past.

Well, there's a very simple reason for that: I don't have a violent past. At least not a past in which I myself was the violator.

Instead, I was always being picked on in school. That pretty much never went away entirely until I was done with school, but the worst of it was in the first few years.

After a particular brutal beating, my mom decided to throw all her good intentions out the window. Until then she had preached that I should just "stay out of the way" and that "they will stop when they get bored" and that I should "call for help".

Now, she wanted me to know how to defend myself.

So she asked the only male person who was around: my grandpa.

I don't remember much of any lessons, but this one sentence stayed with me through all these years. Because of course I did it wrong the first time. And it would have been really bad, **if** I had ever ended up hitting anybody.

I never really questioned how or why my grandpa knew this. I can't remember a single moment where he didn't exude an aura of absolute non-violence.

When I told my mom the Taiji story, she had to laugh. And then she told me the following story.

Like everybody back then, my grandpa got recruited for the army for a few years when he was 18. Apparently around the same time, a local box champion also got recruited.

Whoever was in charge was stricken with the boxer being there. To keep him in form, they would pick out one of the other recruits at random and have them box.

Pretty soon, all the recruits were afraid of being drafted to fight a trained boxer. Nobody wanted to get beaten up next.

Except for my grandpa.

He volunteered, so they wouldn't pick anybody else.

And then he took the boxer down.

He intentionally sent him to the hospital.

I'm not sure how altruistic my grandpa's goals were when he volunteered, but not only did he manage to never get picked for a fight again...nobody else did. The boxing matches suddenly stopped and never came back.

I was shocked when I heard the story. Kinda impressed, but it also shattered the image I had of my grandpa. Until...

_"It's funny, but I never would have thought that of my father."_

_"Huh? What, you didn't know either?"_, I asked my mom.

_"No. He was always kind to everybody and I never saw him raise a hand against anyone."_ My mom paused for a bit. _"The first time I heard this story was at his wake. Of course I was incredulous, but a few of his friends assured me that yes, it happened and they were there."_

As you may have noticed, I'm not humble. I started out this post by bragging about the cool knots I've learned.

But I Knew somebody who was. So humble in fact, that he took a few of his greatest achievements to his grave.

I can't help but think about this as some kind of _reverse foreshadowing_. In movies you often hear about what the protagonist is capable of, before you see it in action. Just think about how people react to the name _John Wick_.

But where the magic of your imagination is broken once you see the action, hearing these stories about my grandpa made him even more magical to me.
