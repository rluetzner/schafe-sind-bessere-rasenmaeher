I've been trying to be more mindful during the day and keep my focus on the task at hand. Whenever I catch my thoughts wandering off, I gently pull them back into the present moment.

It's going great. I just spilt a glass of water while setting up the laptop for this post, because I was pondering what to write. ðŸ˜…

I (re)started this journey rather recently, **but** I discovered that I've already been tying my shoelaces mindfully for the last year or so, ever since I learned about the _Granny Knot_.

Dating this to _last year_ makes me 36 years old when I unearthed the mystery of why my shoelaces kept untying themselves. I came across a link posted on the Fediverse about the _[Ian Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm)_.

The Ian Knot, named after it's inventor and owner of the website Ian Fieggen, is a fast shoelace knot. Ian claims it's the world's fastest shoelace knot and that might very well be -- if you can pull it off.

Anyway, I've always been interested in knots and the Ian Knot was fascinating, even though I couldn't wrap my head around it (at the time). I quickly abandoned my learning efforts. I still don't think that my shoe tying efforts need speeding up, so I didn't feel too bad when I gave up.

However, when I read through the step-by-step guide, I came across a warning about the Granny Knot (queue creepy music).

So, what is a Granny Knot?

Simply put, it's when you tie an _unbalanced_ knot. This happens when you tie both knots in the same direction.

An unbalanced knot is immediately noticeable, because your shoelaces will not lie orthogonal to your shoe (i.e. hang down on the left and right side), but rather run parallel to your shoe and foot.

I had noticed this a few times before, but instead of investigating, I just ignored it and tried to push and pull it into place.

The problem is, that this kind of knot becomes loose more easily. A balanced knot (tied in two opposing directions) will pull tighter when you move your foot, because the two directions work _against_ each other. However, in an unbalanced knot both knots will just continue slipping until they become untied.

Reading about [the Granny Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/grannyknot.htm) was eye opening -- and kinda embarrassing. The explanation seemed so obvious when I read through it and saw the figures.

Ultimately however my embarrassment quickly vanished, because I remembered that none of my friends had figured this out either. I distinctly remember that a few friends noticed that my shoelaces became untied very often. But the best advice they could come up with was that I should change my laces.

I tried different laces for a while, but the issue never went away. Eventually I just started using a double-knot (i.e. tying another knot with the _bunny_ ears).

Now however, I no longer need the double-knot. A proper balanced knot will stay put until I undo it myself.

It took me a while to adjust however and this is where we come back to mindfulness.

As mentioned on Ian's website, the easiest way to fix this is by changing the direction of the _starting knot_. You need to change the direction of one of the knots and it's slightly easier to fix the starting knot, because there's less happening.

I takes quite some time and effort to unlearn the 30+ years of shoe tying habit. I still mess up every now and then, but when I see that crooked Granny Knot, I untie my shoe and start from scratch. It just takes a few seconds and it's absolutely worth it.

I'm never in that much of a hurry, that I want to retie my shoes multiple times a day.

On a side-note, while I was looking for the right pages on Ian's website, I had another look at the Ian Knot. I looked at the step-by-step figures for a while and found something that helps me with the setup.

After the starting knot, you'll need to form two "rings" and the direction of these rings is crucial. I can remember the direction by imagining where the lace would go if I continued wrapping it around.

From there you'll need to push/pull-exchange the open end of the opposed lace and pull it tight.

Weirdly enough I get this right every time I tie my shoes and mess it up whenever I tie my younger son's bib.

As I've mentioned before, I still don't think it's worth to learn the knot to save a second or two of your day. However, there's one hidden benefit I missed when I looked at it a year ago: you'll always end up with a balanced knot.

I've tried a few different approaches and I always either end up with a balanced knot or _nothing_. This, to me, is the real benefit. Once I've managed to tie an Ian Knot, it'll hold as long as I need it to.
