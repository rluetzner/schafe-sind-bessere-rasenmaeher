I think it's time to reflect on the progress I've made the last few weeks. I've been meaning to do these updates more regularly, but I've been doing other things instead.

## Positive phrasing

If you've been following along, you might be confused by the number _2_ in the title. I renamed the previous post from _old habits die hard_ to _one step at a time_, because it sounds a tad more positive.

_Old habits die hard_ was meant as a joke, but as I've written before _these words have power_. I find the phrase fatalistic. It's much easier to give in, if you keep reminding yourself that things are hard. I'd much rather remind myself that any amount of progress is good progress.

Other than that, I noticed that as I've been in a very foul mood lately, I also fell back into "God, I hate this" and similar thoughts.

As far as I'm aware, I caught every single instance and remembered that I wanted to refrain from such negativity. I'll count this as a win, even if I often lacked the energy to go through with it and rephrase my thoughts.

## Finding joy in mundane things

This is somewhat entangled with the previous point. Things are easier to enjoy when you're in a good mood.

I'll keep an eye on this, but I don't worry too much right now.

## Battling FOMO / Deliberate media consumption

This is one area where I'm very satisfied with what I've achieved. I've managed to completely turn around my perception of _missing out_.

There are a few things that I want to get to _eventually_, but I'm also keeping an open mind and might just skip them if enough time passes.

One realization I'm especially proud of came in the form of a post on the Fediverse. I hadn't really thought it through beforehand, but it turned into something beautiful when I wrote it out.

[My posts are set to expire automatically](https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester/113279335121224588), so I'll copy the text here. For context, the discussion was about being overwhelmed with the amount of new and interesting movies and TV shows that are released.

> I had this exact same feeling for a long time, until recently where I finally remembered that all of it is just here to distract me. Videogames, music, books, movies, TV shows.  
> Not saying they're all bad. Often they are very nice and pleasant distractions.  
> But it still keeps me away from the real world.  
> This realization has helped me tremendously. I've decided to stop running, trying to catch up, and instead enjoy what I'm doing right now. ðŸ™‚

As for spoilers or _being left out_ of conversations, I came up with this piece of wisdom.

> I haven't run into such a situation yet. But I actually think it might even be freeing.  
> If somebody wants to tell me about "cool thing that happened" I'm ready to listen.  
> At this point I'm not planning to watch any of the new Star Wars series or Marvel movies, so feel free to spoiler away and let's talk about it. Maybe just talking about it is still cool.  
> And I will forget anyway if I ever get to watch it years down the road. ðŸ˜…

## Getting angry...at my kids

Hard to measure, but I feel like it's still better than it used to be. Things are in constant fluctuation, as my younger kid is also discovering autonomy. This adds on top of his older brother pushing back on **everyting** -- even things he knows he'd enjoy. His latest excuse not to do things is _"that's boring"_ -- which was kinda cute for a second there and got annoying real quick.

Nevertheless, we had an awesome moment a few days ago. Both kids were playing their usual game of "runaway" while I was trying to get them into their pyjamas. I eventually got the older one into his and he left to brush his teeth with his mom. I then tried to convince his younger brother, but after a few minutes I gave up.

I was mentally exhausted. I was done. No more chasing, no more talking.

I didn't break down crying, even though I was pretty close to it. Instead I just unfocused my eyes and stared into nothingness.

That's how my older kid found me when he came back from the bathroom.

"Daddy, why do you look so sad?"

I was very surprised by the question, because him noticing and reading my facial expression shows a spark of empathy. It's a very distinct break in the usual pattern of _but I want!!!!_

"I'm sad, because I have absolutely no energy left. I'm trying to be nice, but I need you and your brother to do certain things. I've run out of patience and that's why I resort to shouting. I can't think of other options anymore. I'd much rather enjoy the time I have with you instead of getting angry."

I don't think he understood everything and he doesn't have to. But he sat on my lap and hugged me for a long while.

## Listening to my body

I am so tired...

Need sleep, but won't give.

This definitely needs more work. ðŸ˜…

Not exactly FOMO, but at the end of the day, I just want to _do something_. For myself, on my own or with my wife -- without kids.

Having a few hours of peace and quiet in the evening satisfies the desire of wanting to _do something_. Getting to spend some quality time with my wife also recharges the battery somewhat.

But it won't fix my exhaustion. Only sleep will do.

I'm aware of that, but I haven't managed to break out of it yet. Maybe a good first step would be to go to bed at 22:00 instead after 23:00. Or maybe 22:30. _One step at a time._

However, I've managed to keep my weight, which is a good sign. I haven't lost any, but from experience I know that these plateaus happen every now and then. I'm confident that the numbers will be dropping again soon.

## Meditating

I've been relying on _meditation on the side_, which wasn't a particularly good idea. Instead of taking the necessary time out, I was so enchanted with the idea of doing things mindfully and getting my meditation in that way.

As it turned out, my thoughts were spinning out of control, whenever I tried to do that. I think with more focus I could have managed to reign them in and sort everything away. But as I was always doing something else, e.g. riding a bike, I couldn't take focus out of that activity.

I've had a rough couple of weeks, in particular because I've been trying to track down a nasty bug at work. It was elusive and undeterministic. As it turns out, I just wasted 3 weeks, because the bug was never there. My test client was misconfigured and would generate garbage data after a certain amount of time.

Now that this is no longer on my mind, I think things will quiet down a bit.

Nevertheless, I should take a few minutes in the evenings to tame the whirlwind.

## Conclusion

While I'm less satisfied with the progress I've made compared to the last time, writing it all down showed me that I'm at least aware of what needs more work. So even though I'm not acting on it in all situations, I'm still going through my days a bit more mindful than before.

Let me know how things are going on your end. ðŸ™‚
