Sometimes we Germans have nice descriptive words for things. One of these words is _"Mitgefühl"_ -- compassion. However, if you split it into it's constituent words and translate them, you'll end up with "with feeling" -- "with" as in togetherness.

In a sense, from the words that make up _"Mitgefühl"_, it's much closer to _empathy_, even if we Germans do not use it that way.

Generally, being compassionate and empathic are considered good traits.

You can however be **too** empathic.

I can't remember when I first noticed it. I guess I must have read it in a book before, because otherwise the idea wouldn't even have occurred to me.

**Some of the feelings I experience are not my own.**

Maybe you've heard of the expression _"sense the room"_. Well, that's me. I'm usually good at figuring out how people around me are doing. Up to a fault even, because I'll eventually unintentionally make that emotion my own.

The stronger the emotion, the more likely I am to pick it up. That means I'm most susceptible to

- anger,
- despair,
- emotional pain,
- intense joy.

As you can see the scales are slightly skewed towards negative emotions. It's pretty rare to find people that exude a strong aura of happiness. You're much more likely to run into people that are angry or caught in deep sadness. Of course another amplifier is how close you are to the affected person.

This will also happen with songs, although I'm much better at recognizing where these emotions come from and put them away again. _Slayer_ will fill me with righteous anger and make me restless, whereas _Passenger_ or _Tracy Chapman_ will make me cry.

I can't look into other people, but I assume most people have experienced this to some extent. However, from observation I'd say that most people are better at putting these "false" feelings away again.

I've always struggled with that part.

Over the years I've built up a 3 step approach to deal with these situations.

1. Try to cheer up the other person.
2. Try to separate my own feelings from "false" emotions.
3. Run away.

Not super proud of step 3, even less proud to admit that there were multiple situations where I left a good friend hanging, because I could no longer handle their emotions.

Well, now that I'm a dad, I've lost access to step 3, at least where my kids are involved.

I've become pretty good at dealing with sadness, but I'm also stuck with their anger and frustration. They can't control it yet and the longer I'm exposed, the more I struggle myself.

Anger is the emotion I struggle with the most and the reason why I went digging for a way out.

But there's also another state of mind that I hadn't noticed until I started writing down my thoughts: _restlessness_. The kids are always fidgeting, drumming their fingers and feet, doing three things at the same time, running around.

Just to be clear: I'm not putting this on my kids -- or even other people for that matter. Kids will be kids, and even though it drives me crazy that they **cannot** (!!!!) sit still...it's totally normal.

The older one is incredibly agile. He's an amazing climber and runner. He's learning something new every day and wants to try out everything all the time.

His younger brother has "just" learned to walk (well, around the start of this year) and movement is still new to him. Lately he's discovered how to jump properly, with both feet leaving the ground. It looks incredibly cute. And of course now he needs to keep up with his older brother and run around just as wildly.

It's impossible for them to keep still. And they shouldn't have to.

I really need to start working more on step 2: _try to separate my own feelings from "false" emotions_.

Maybe writing all this down is a good first step.

And maybe recognizing that I'm in a base state of constant agitation and where it's coming from might just help me with the anger issue.
