Alright people! Time for the nitty-gritty!

My last few posts might have made me seem like a Zen-master, so get ready for the truth! ðŸ˜…

This is meant to be an objective retrospective of how I'm doing on my way to being more mindful. As objective as I can be about myself.

There are however a few problems with this approach.

The most obvious one being, that I haven't defined any goals I want to reach.

## No goals?

So far, I've mainly followed the advice **focus on the present moment** and observed a bunch of positive changes that come with my interpretation of that.

Maybe somewhere down the line I'll define proper goals for these topics, but so far I'm pretty happy with _staying in the moment_ and I'll just assume that these benefits will come and stay naturally.

Let's put this down as **"the journey is it's own reward."**

## Positive phrasing

This is somewhat of a prerequisite for the next topic _finding joy in mundane things_. Of course it also becomes easier to keep a positive perspective, if you're enjoying yourself more.

Things are going...okay. Staying positive was pretty easy as long as I was on vacation, but it's gotten harder once I returned to work.

I still manage it most of the time, but there are occasions, where I'd just rather sit down and **rest**. I don't think needing rest actually violates this principle, but it does put a limit on my positivity.

## Finding joy in mundane things

This was the most obvious benefit, when I started keeping my mind right here and now.

**Household chores were suddenly kinda "fun". Getting something done also felt like a significant accomplishment and gave me an intense mood boost.**

Still works like a charm...given that I've managed to motivate myself to get started.

Lately I've become unsure if I'm actually doing things _joyfully_ or rather just _pushing on_, because nobody else would take care of it.

**_Pushing on / pushing through_ feels absolutely wrong. It's mentally draining.**

Once I noticed this pattern, it was like an alarm bell went off inside of me. The _"argh, I'll do it"_ mentality is part of what pushed me into the deep hole of physical and mental exhaustion I've mostly managed to crawl out of in the last few weeks.

## Battling FOMO / Deliberate media consumption

I associate _fear of missing out_ mostly with videogames, movies and TV shows and particularly the feeling of _not being able to join in on the discussion_.

FOMO is of course a much [broader topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), but missing out on media is honestly the only part that affects me. Otherwise I'm pretty happy with my life choices. I have a few memories of things I'd rather have done differently -- some of which I want to write about in the future -- but these things are in the past and I can't change them. I don't tend to dwell on these.

I've mostly managed to quiet the part of me that felt bad whenever I couldn't squeeze in time for media of any kind. That may sound laughable to some of you, but it put a real damper on my mood when I didn't manage to fit podcasts, games, movies or TV shows into my day.

It's not like I don't spend _any_ time with media, but I chose these moments more deliberately.

**I've realized that I'm in control and can choose how and with which kind of media I want to interact.**

Let's give a proper example. I know I've started a whole bunch of videogames, most of which I do intend to continue at one point or another. But right now I'm in the mood for some _Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines_.

Previously I'd also put on headphones whenever I was stuck with a chore for more than a minute, but now I spend a lot of quiet time folding the laundry, taking care of the dishes or taking out the garbage.

I don't strictly adhere to _staying in the present_ every single moment. **I do allow my thoughts to wander, because one pretty obvious thing about having some quiet time is, you're spending time with your own thoughts.** Kinda like meditating.

I do most things on auto-pilot, but even so I've noticed that having my mind wander is very different from paying attention to a podcast on the side. I can find my way back to the present moment much easier if there's something that needs my immediate attention.

## Getting angry...at my kids

The initial problem I wanted to tackle when I started down the mindfulness road.

I'd like to think that things have gotten better, but I'm still struggling. Especially when I get stressed. Ideally I wouldn't stress out in the first place, but sometimes even the present moment has enough worries to break me.

I think I do rather well, as long as I can keep to myself. But as soon as people start pushing me (e.g. _"Dad, where's my apply already?"_), my concentration starts to crumble.

## Listening to my body

Once I started paying more attention to the current moment, I pretty much stopped overeating.

While that was easier on vacation, where I could have a proper breakfast, I still kinda keep it up at home. There are days when I have to skip breakfast to make things work in the morning, so I'll fast and eat more at lunch. But overall I'm apparently still slowly loosing weight.

Another very simple thing I noticed is that I no longer hop around like an idiot when I try to put on my socks and trousers every morning.

**I once thought that my balance improved by doing Taiji, but as it turns out you just need to pay attention when you're doing things.**

Then again...earlier today I felt extremely tired.

Like I would fall asleep every time I blinked.

Even though I was riding a bike in traffic at the moment.

And now I'm writing a blog post at 22:30, so make of that what you will. ðŸ˜¬

## Meditating

My Taiji teacher used to quote

> "Everybody should meditate at least ten minutes a day.  
> Except for people that don't have ten minutes.  
> They should meditate for an hour."

Apparently it's an old Zen saying and the durations vary wildly.

It's become one of my favorite quotes...even though I don't manage to actually live by it.

I managed to sit down in meditation twice in the last weeks, so it's nowhere near a daily habit. Nevertheless, both times were amazing experiences.

I used to meditate according to specific guidelines in the past (check in with your body, focus on the breathing). The last two times I sat down and started out with a specific exercise (focus on the breath / conjure up your five year old self), but then I let my mind flow where it wanted to go.

**It felt like I had kept my thoughts chained up for far too long.**

Some long forgotten memories have bubbled up again; some painful, some happy. As my thoughts were flowing they also washed a few insights ashore. I can't recall anything specific right now, but I somehow felt...wiser after meditating.

I definitely want to make more time for meditation.

## Conclusion

So that's that.

Reading through what I wrote, I'm actually pretty satisfied with where I am. Which sounds and feels in tune with the principles I want to apply to my life.

Let me know how things are going on your end. ðŸ™‚
