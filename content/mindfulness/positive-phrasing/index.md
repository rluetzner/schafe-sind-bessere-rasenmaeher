_"Ah fuck, I still need to put the dishes into the dishwasher."_

_"Man, I hate these meetings."_

_"Kill me already. I don't wanna..."_

Recently I've been reminded of something my boss told me a few years ago.

The product I was working on at that time was **legacy code** (queue scary sound effects). Horrible, messy code that was written more than two decades ago.

One component in particular was _the_ text book example of all the worst practices you can think of.

Thousand lines of code classes? Sure.

Hundreds of lines of code for methods? You betcha.

Circular dependencies? Someone made it possible.

Near infinite inheritance trees, low-level types, one character variable names, outdated comments, misleading method names, parameter hell, unsafe optimizations, long-running flaky end-to-end tests, absolutely no unit tests...? **We've got you covered!**

So eventually to brighten our day, we added a ton of memes to our chatbot. Whenever someone would send a message containing the component's name, the bot would post a meme, e.g. an animated GIF of a Stormtrooper with a flamethrower saying "KILL IT WITH FIRE!"

One day my boss took me aside.

"Hey, what's with these memes I see in chat every day?", he asked.

"Oh, they're just a bit of an inside joke. They trigger whenever someone mentions component _X_."

"Okay." Then, after a short pause. "So -- you think it's a bad application?"

That caught me a bit off guard. "Well...no. I think it's badly written and could use a good cleanup. But I don't think it's bad software. It does what it's supposed to do."

"You realize that this thing is bringing in the big bucks, right?", he asked. "We sell the whole package, but the product only really works because of this one component."

I actually had _not_ thought about this at all.

He went on. Not chiding me or anything, but merely stating facts. "Have you considered that we're onboarding a bunch of new people and all they learn about this thing that keeps us fed and warm is that we should _kill it with fire_?"

Again, no. But I was catching on.

"These words have power. Especially if you keep hearing them again and again, day in -- day out."

I deleted the meme triggers the very same day.

FYI, the component is still around. It's actually a lot of fun figuring out ways to modernize it without breaking it's current behavior.

About a week ago, I noticed that I fell into the same habit with other things in my life. I'd groan whenever my wife asked me to do _yet another thing_, I'd curse under my breath when stomping up and down the stairs to bring out the trash, etc.

Being more mindful is my thing now, so I noticed -- and then I decided to stop.

Whenever I caught myself thinking _"I hate..."_, I stopped myself and said _"You know what? Give it a chance!"_

Surprisingly the effects were immediately noticeable. While I won't say that I suddenly started enjoying all the household chores, I have to admit that I at least found _some_ joy in my daily tasks.

You know what? There's a certain satisfaction in folding the laundry _just right_.

I also noticed that I'm more social than before. I'm no longer trying to duck people and I've had some really nice conversations.

Overall, I feel much happier than before.

...

**BUT** -- parent's evening in kindergarten has got to be the end boss of that!

Fuck that! It's boring, it's long, it's people, it's uncomfortable chairs, it's

...

No, wait. That's not where I was going.

So, as you might have guessed: yesterday was indeed parent's evening in kindergarten.

I had skipped the last two occasions and it was the beginning of the new kindergarten year, so I convinced myself to go.

Not only that, but I also convinced myself to give it a chance. To go and _try_ to enjoy it.

And I kinda did. In fact, it wasn't half bad. Sure, I can imagine countless things I'd have liked to do more, but it was still okay.

I sneaked in some mindfulness exercises, mainly focusing on the present and listening intently to what the kindergarten teachers had to say. It wasn't all super interesting, but there were bits and pieces that were new to me.

There were also a few new parents there and I managed to remember all their names. I even made some small talk and feel a bit more connected to the others now.

In the end, I offered to stay behind to clean the mugs while the teachers were prepping the room for the kids the next day. It felt like a really good and accomplished evening.

Words do have a strange intangible power. And I think I've relearned how to wield them.
