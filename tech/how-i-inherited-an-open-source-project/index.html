<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=/tags/dotnet>Dotnet</a><br><b>Estimated reading time: </b>10 minutes<article><p>On Monday the 6th February of 2023, I woke up to find a surprising email in my inbox.</p><p><figure><img src=mail_inbox.webp alt="An email with the subject RE: Chord Generator"><figcaption>An email with the subject RE: Chord Generator</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=what-is-a-chord-generator>What is a Chord Generator?!</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s go back a little in history&mldr;</p><p>Back in 2017 I remember talking to my boss at work about GitHub. I mentioned, that I had a GitHub account, but at that time I only had one project uploaded and otherwise not interacted with it. He then encouraged me to seek out open source projects that pique my interest and see if I can contribute to them.</p><p>I did so that very evening. My search criteria were simple: it had to be written in C#, the only programming language I was semi-fluent in at that time, and I wanted it to be a smaller project, because it felt less intimidating than starting with a well-known one.</p><p>After a lot of searching I settled on this one: <a href=https://github.com/einaregilsson/ChordImageGenerator>Einar Egilsson&rsquo;s Chord Generator</a>.</p><p>The project grabbed my interest, because besides programming I was also an avid guitar player at that time.</p><p>I cloned the repo and ran the project. Pretty much immediately I saw that optically the output could be improved by converting &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;#&rsquo; to their <a href=https://github.com/einaregilsson/ChordImageGenerator/pull/6>musical representations</a> &lsquo;‚ô≠&rsquo; and &lsquo;‚ôØ&rsquo;.</p><p>I also made a complete fool out of myself heavily refactoring the small code base, which Einar correctly rejected when I sent him a <a href=https://github.com/einaregilsson/ChordImageGenerator/pull/4>pull request</a>. He was very civil about rejecting that one and gave me solid advice for the future.</p><p>Here are basically my only interactions with the project and Einar Egilsson.</p><p><figure><img src=github_pull_request.webp alt="Screenshot of a merged GitHub pull request to replace # and b in Chord names with the according musical signs"><figcaption>Screenshot of a merged GitHub pull request to replace # and b in Chord names with the according musical signs</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img src=github_refactoring_pull_request.webp alt="Screenshot of a closed GitHub pull request named Refactoring and Code Cleanup"><figcaption>Screenshot of a closed GitHub pull request named Refactoring and Code Cleanup</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=back-in-2023an-unexpected-mail>Back in 2023&mldr;an unexpected mail</h2><p>Here is a slightly abbreviated version of the mail I opened up <strong>six years</strong> later, with permission from Kendall Miller.</p><blockquote><p>Hello Robert!</p><p>I see you‚Äôve contributed to GitHub‚Äô s ‚ÄúChord Generator‚Äù site. Recently I tried to access this resource to create chords but the site was inaccessible: the ‚Äú404 Error‚Äù code appeared on the screen. So, I looked up the developer to text him and found this: Einar √û√≥r Egilsson was born in Reykjav√≠k on August 23, 1980. He died in the Canary Islands on January 10, 2022. [&mldr;]</p><p>I‚Äôm hoping there is some way to still access this ‚Äúopen resource;‚Äù and, I was hoping that you had the expertise to tell me if this is so. [&mldr;] I‚Äôm sick to my stomach that this resource may be gone. I used it all of the time; and fairly recently, it stopped being accessible. [&mldr;] I‚Äôm [&mldr;] an avid guitar transcriber (I‚Äôve worked w/ the late Kenny Rankin and Stephen Bishop&mldr;creating detailed tablatures of their songs. Einar‚Äôs site was invaluable for this purpose allowing me to create any odd chord that might ever be needed!</p><p>Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Warmest Regards,<br>Kendall Miller</p></blockquote><p>That took me by surprise. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know Einar personally, I felt a pang of sadness for his sudden passing. He died young and in seemingly best health. At a later point I found a comment from him on GitHub, where he promised somebody to take a look at their pull request after his vacation ended &ndash; in early January of 2022.</p><p>I promised Kendall to take a look at the project and try to restore an instance of the Chord Generator web service.</p><blockquote><p>Hello Kendall,</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry to hear about Einar. My only interaction with him was a single contribution to the Chord Generator tool back in 2016 (I think?), but nevertheless, I&rsquo;m saddened to hear of his demise.</p><p>[&mldr;] I&rsquo;m 99% sure I could easily provide you with an alternative web address, but restoring
<a href=http://chordgenerator.net/>http://chordgenerator.net/</a> will be very hard, seeing as the web domain is still owned by Einar.</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, I only contributed once to the project, but I&rsquo;d be willing to keep it alive for the time being. However, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, Michail Vourlakos seemed to be a bit more involved. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve contacted him as well. If he is willing to continue the project, I&rsquo;d rather give him precedence.</p><p>For now, I&rsquo;ll have a look at the code this evening (CET) and try to get a test instance of the service up and running.</p><p>Best regards,<br>Robert</p></blockquote><aside><p><p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering: Michail Vourlakos never came back up.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t contacted him directly as of the time I&rsquo;m writing this, but he also didn&rsquo;t react to any of my movements on the original project on GitHub.</p></p></aside><h2 id=getting-my-hands-dirty>Getting my hands dirty</h2><p>Getting started turned out to be a bit more involved than I first expected.</p><p>I had made the switch to Linux on my private machine about a year before and my initial plan was to deploy Chord Generator to my trusty Rapsberry Pi. From work I knew that .NET worked perfectly well on Linux, so I thought that the migration should be trivial.</p><p>I forked and cloned the Git repo and was overjoyed to find that Einar had already mostly converted it to .NET Core 2.2.</p><p><em>Yay! So the project is already cross-platform!</em> ü§©</p><p>I installed .NET 6 on my machine and tried running the code, but the compiler immediately complained that the .NET Core 2.2 SDK wasn&rsquo;t available. I tried for a while to download older versions of the .NET SDK, but gave up after half an hour of searching. There&rsquo;s probably a way, but I couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p><p>So, I decided to upgrade the project to .NET 6. While the upgrade steps to .NET Core 3 seemed daunting at first, I realized that in this specific case there weren&rsquo;t much breaking changes. I was able to upgrade the project to .NET 6 in less than half an hour.</p><p>However, I then had to find out that the System.Drawing.Common namespace used in the original project has been <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only>deprecated on non-Windows machines since .NET 6</a>.</p><p><em>Well shit!</em> üò©</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to install older SDKs and I couldn&rsquo;t just upgrade the project, because a vital dependency no longer worked (on Linux aka non-Windows).</p><p>After maybe half an hour of experimenting with different alternatives (as found on <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/44428480>StackOverflow, where else!?</a>) I was close to giving up.</p><p>Giving up, as in renting a Windows VPS somewhere to get the project up and running. At least for a while until I figured out how to migrate the code.</p><p>As my final ray of hope, I turned to Docker.</p><h2 id=now-were-docking>Now we&rsquo;re docking!</h2><p>At first glance the <a href=https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk>.NET SDK Docker page</a> didn&rsquo;t look too promising. The only featured tags were <em>6.0</em> and <em>7.0</em>, which wouldn&rsquo;t get me very far.</p><p>After a bit of digging however, I turned up an ugly <a href=https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/dotnet/sdk/tags/list>JSON formatted list of old tags</a>.</p><p>I wrote a quick and dirty Dockerfile to see if the project would build and run. And lo and behold&mldr;<strong>it did</strong>! ü§©</p><p>Kendall had sent me an example tabulature containing chords from the original Chord Generator. Upon closer inspection I saw that the results weren&rsquo;t exact 1:1 matches, but they were close enough to be usable. This is due to the <code>libgdiplus</code> reimplementation generating slightly different results compared to <code>GDI+</code> on Windows, which is cited as the main reason it is no longer supported starting with .NET 6.</p><p>Nevertheless, I was happy to have gotten this far. I fiddled a bit with <code>docker buildx</code>, but ultimately ended up pushing the code, checking it out on my Raspi and building an ARM64 image there.</p><p>This is the mail I sent on the evening of the February 6th.</p><blockquote><p>Hello Kendall!</p><p>[&mldr;]</p><p>I&rsquo;m working on setting up another Chord Generator site. As mentioned before, I won&rsquo;t be able to update Einar&rsquo;s website, so you&rsquo;ll need to use a different address. As soon as I&rsquo;ve got everything set up, I&rsquo;ll send you the link.</p><p>[&mldr;] Things are looking pretty good and I &mldr;</p><p>Sorry for the interruption, but I thought I might leave it in. So I left some processes running in the background while writing this email and now I&rsquo;ve actually got a service up and running for you:</p><p><a href=https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de>https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de</a></p><p>I hope it continues to serve you well. Feel free to contact me if anything isn&rsquo;t working as expected.</p><p>Best regards,
Robert</p></blockquote><p>And here&rsquo;s the response. üòä</p><blockquote><p>Hello Robert,</p><p>Oh my goodness! I just opened your &ldquo;Chord Generator&rdquo; page and it works PERFECTLY! Thank you so much for restoring this resource! I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for allowing this project, to which you contributed, continue into the future for others. I don&rsquo;t think you know just how appreciated you are&mldr;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been an honor to correspond with you!</p><p>Your friend,
Kendall Miller</p></blockquote><p><figure><img src=chord_generator.webp alt="A screenshot of the Chord Generator web service."><figcaption>A screenshot of the Chord Generator web service.</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=bugs-bugs-bugsand-an-outlook>Bugs, bugs, bugs&mldr;and an outlook</h2><p>The heading makes this sound more dramatic than it actually was. On the next day Kendall reported two smaller bugs, which I was able to fix the same day. üòÖ</p><p>I&rsquo;ve since put in some work in upgrading this project to .NET 6. I initially intended to stop at .NET 5, but for whatever reason, the deprecation exception for System.Drawing.Common didn&rsquo;t trigger in a .NET 6 container.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also started replacing System.Drawing.Common with <a href=https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp>ImageSharp</a>. I was hoping to find a project that would retain the same API, but Einar was using very low-level methods to draw the chords and I was unable to find a suitable replacement. At the time of this writing, the changes are not yet merged. Technically, everything is in order, but the end result differs a tad too much for me to be satisfied.</p><p>In addition to that, I&rsquo;ve tracked down the person managing the late Einar&rsquo;s GitHub account. I&rsquo;ve contacted them via mail and opened up an <a href=https://github.com/einaregilsson/ChordImageGenerator/issues/11>issue</a> on the original project page, but haven&rsquo;t heard back so far.</p><h2 id=resources-on-einar-egilsson>Resources on Einar Egilsson</h2><p>The most I&rsquo;ve learned about Einar has been kindly provided by Kendall, who did a lot of research.</p><p>Apparently he hit it big time back with his company Rau√∞√°s Hugvrij√∞ and <a href=https://cardgames.io/>CardGames.io</a>.</p><p><a href=https://www.vb.is/frettir/gamaldags-netleikjasida-malar-gull/>Here&rsquo;s</a> an icelandic article about their success story.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also an <a href="https://www.mbl.is/mogginn/bladid/innskraning/?redirect=%2Fmogginn%2Fbladid%2Fgrein%2F1801229%2F%3Ft%3D701296233&amp;page_name=grein&amp;grein_id=1801229">obituary</a> on another icelandic news site.</p><aside><p>You&rsquo;ll have to find a ways to translate them yourself; I was unable to find a privacy-friendly solution.</p></aside><p>There&rsquo;s also <a href=https://einaregilsson.com/>Einar&rsquo;s blog</a>, which luckily is in English.</p><p>Here are some articles I&rsquo;ve read, although I haven&rsquo;t read that many (yet):</p><ul><li><a href=https://einaregilsson.com/story-of-cardgames-io/>The story of CardGames.io</a></li><li><a href=https://einaregilsson.com/an-easter-egg-for-one-user-luke-skywalker/>An easter egg for one user: Luke Skywalker</a></li><li><a href=https://einaregilsson.com/chord-image-generator/>Chord Image Generator</a></li></ul><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts</h2><p>I&rsquo;m still amazed that Kendall found me via a GitHub contribution I made six years ago. Writing this blog post helped make this a bit less surreal. üòÖ</p><p>I&rsquo;m really happy that I was able to restore this tool and help Kendall continue working on tabulatures. I hope that other people who might have used Einar&rsquo;s tool will eventually find out about the new URL. And, of course, I&rsquo;m happy to keep a part (however small) of Einar Egilsson&rsquo;s legacy alive.</p><p>Finally, to paraphrase Einar Egilsson from his blog post about the Chord Image Generator:</p><blockquote><p>You are free to link to images directly on <a href=https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de>https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de</a> from your own website, although I make no guarantees about uptime, performance or anything like that.</p></blockquote><p>Enjoy! üôÇ</p><hr><h2 id=edit---2023-04-14>Edit - 2023-04-14</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve reached out to <a href=https://github.com/gzur>Gissur Thorhallsson</a>, who&rsquo;s taken ownership of Einar&rsquo;s account, and they kindly added a note to the original repo, pointing to my fork. The <a href=https://github.com/einaregilsson/ChordImageGenerator>original repo</a> on GitHub has been archived. Now it&rsquo;s official: I&rsquo;ve have fully inherited this project.</p><p>Gissur also promised to look into ownership of the domain <a href=https://chordgenerator.net>https://chordgenerator.net</a>, but with the added link on the original repo on GitHub I&rsquo;m optimistic that people will find their way to <a href=https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de>https://chordgenerator.luetzners.de</a>.</p></article></main><footer><p>¬© 2024 Robert L√ºtzner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
