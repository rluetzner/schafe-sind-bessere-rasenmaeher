Many thanks Siddharth Barman, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have gotten this far without you.
Be advised that the OpenCover project has been archived and is no longer actively developed. There are FOSS alternatives available, but this is what I got working, so I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with it until it breaks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to move most of my development workflows to the terminal. However, one of the last few things that&amp;rsquo;s been missing in my toolbelt, was gathering code coverage.</description></item></channel></rss>
