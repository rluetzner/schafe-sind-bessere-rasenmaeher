I had a major in Physics, but my heart was no longer in it. Instead I wanted to write computer programs. After writing countless applications and receiving a few rejections (and a whole bunch of nothing), I finally hit a breakthrough. A small local company was willing to invite me for an interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was in August of 2015, which I remember very well, because it was an incredibly hot day and I came fully armored in a suit&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. I was expecting to be interviewed by some kind of total hard-ass boss (also in a suit) that would quickly dismantle my &amp;ldquo;pretend&amp;rdquo; knowledge of programming&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. What came in were three guys, dressed in T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
