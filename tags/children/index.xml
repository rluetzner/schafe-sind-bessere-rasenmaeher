I tend to alternate very heavily between watching movies and tv shows, playing videogames and reading books. This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot of videogames with what little free time I have.
Nevertheless, I do have a candidate for my book of the year 2023: A majom mamája.
The cover for A majom mamája. The book is written by Julia Donaldson, an English writer mostly known for The Gruffalo or Room on the Broom, and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.</description></item></channel></rss>
