To be precise: I added it to the 30 or so Docker containers that were already running on my Raspberry Pi 4 &amp;ndash; and it finally caused my already wobbly setup to collapse.
Immich comes with multiple containers, one of which is solely responsible for generating a local A.I. model to match people in photos. I tried a few ways to limit resources on the containers, but other services still kept crashing and the whole system became unresponsive.</description></item></channel></rss>
