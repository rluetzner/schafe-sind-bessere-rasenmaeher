&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Man, I hate these meetings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Kill me already. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of something my boss told me a few years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The product I was working on at that time was &lt;strong>legacy code&lt;/strong> (queue scary sound effects). Horrible, messy code that was written more than two decades ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One component in particular was &lt;em>the&lt;/em> text book example of all the worst practices you can think of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I came to love Linux</title><link>/tech/how-i-came-to-love-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 16:05:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/how-i-came-to-love-linux/</guid><description>&lt;aside>&lt;p>&lt;p>This is the 2nd part of a series where I rant about how I ended up with Linux as my daily driver.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember the first time I heard about this mystical alternative OS &lt;em>Linux&lt;/em>. I was probably 15 or 16 and I must have heard about it from my friend&amp;rsquo;s older brother, who was studying computer science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I learned to use a PC</title><link>/tech/how-i-learned-to-use-a-pc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 12:41:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/how-i-learned-to-use-a-pc/</guid><description>&lt;aside>&lt;p>&lt;p>This is the 1st part of a series where I rant about how I ended up with Linux as my daily driver.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I was 10, my mom decided that we too needed a PC in our household. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly sure what she&amp;rsquo;d do with it (probably write letters or something, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember seeing her do that particularly often), but it was &lt;em>all the rage&lt;/em>, so we needed one too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Miez Attack, or how I got a job with a game about shooting cats</title><link>/tech/miez-attack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 20:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/miez-attack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back in 2015, after I had graduated from university, I was looking for jobs. I had a major in Physics, but my heart was no longer in it. Instead I wanted to write computer programs. After writing countless applications and receiving a few rejections (and a whole bunch of nothing), I finally hit a breakthrough. A small local company was willing to invite me for an interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was in August of 2015, which I remember very well, because it was an incredibly hot day and I came fully armored in a suit&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. I was expecting to be interviewed by some kind of total hard-ass boss (also in a suit) that would quickly dismantle my &amp;ldquo;pretend&amp;rdquo; knowledge of programming&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. What came in were three guys, dressed in T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
