&lt;h2 id="less-things-break">Less things break&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kinda obvious in hindsight, but less things break when you&amp;rsquo;re being more careful. I&amp;rsquo;m not deliberately trying to be more careful, but whenever I can I try to keep myself in the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An easy example that comes to mind is: &amp;ldquo;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this budging!? Maybe if I apply more force, it&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;hellip;well, shit&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mindful Parenting #3 - Intuitive Friendship</title><link>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 19:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I had the chance to observe this kind of &lt;em>instant friendship&lt;/em> forming, the way only kids seem to be capable of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re still on vacation and went out for lunch nearby. Next to the restaurant was a playground with a small wooden locomotive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is Molly&amp;rdquo;, my older son proclaimed as he sat behind the steering wheel. His younger brother of course playing along as a passenger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re reading Jim Button together, so I immediately knew what he was talking about. He also kinda addressed a nearby mom, who looked very confused. I explained that it&amp;rsquo;s the little locomotive from Jim Button.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ramblings #1 - Unhealthy media consumption</title><link>/mindfulness/ramblings-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/ramblings-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not the first person to notice this, nor am I the first person to write about it, but &lt;strong>not everything that is meant to help you relax is healthy&lt;/strong>. And I&amp;rsquo;m not even talking about drugs, but rather movies, TV shows or video games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of all these things and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with spending a relaxed evening in front of the TV. I&amp;rsquo;d go as far as to say there&amp;rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with spending a whole week with a captivating video game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mindful Parenting #2</title><link>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 12:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed so far:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m often annoyed when my kids want to talk to me. I&amp;rsquo;m usually already doing something else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m more open to pay attention to my younger son. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s favoritism, although things are definitely easier with him. He plays a lot by himself and is more emotionally balanced&amp;hellip;for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No matter how hard I try, there will be times where I simply cannot attend to my kids. Work needs to be done, bills paid, groceries need to be bought and prepared. Not everything can happen when the kids are in bed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A bit ashamed that I only think about this now, but I&amp;rsquo;ve known for a long time that I&amp;rsquo;m susceptible to the emotions of other people. My older son becomes angry very quickly right now and that triggers me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Things I can do:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mindful Parenting #1</title><link>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 21:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/mindful-parenting-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been angry a lot these last few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying a great big burning ball of anger inside me that threatens to burst out. Occasionally it does, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My older child is now about 4.5 years old. He&amp;rsquo;s craving autonomy and control. Control over everything: his body, his parents, his brother, his surroundings&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s maddening. He does so many small things that drive me &lt;strong>crazy&lt;/strong>!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But ultimately these are all just small things.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
