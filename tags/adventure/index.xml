&lt;p>It starts out as a pretty slow burn, but that&amp;rsquo;s alright for the horror genre. Once it&amp;rsquo;s got it&amp;rsquo;s hooks into you, it becomes really hard to put down. With two kids and a daytime job, I only get a few hours to myself every evening. If not for that, I can guarantee that I would have finished this in a single sitting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Return to Monkey Island (2022)</title><link>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 21:13:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;d ever get: a new Monkey Island from Ron Gilbert. And as expected it fits in perfectly with the first two Monkey Island games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first contact with the Monkey Island series was with &lt;strong>The Curse of Monkey Island&lt;/strong>. I did not know at that time that it was the third entry in the series, but I remember enjoying the humor and slapstick. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much further than the second chapter as a kid, although I finished it sometime later with a walkthrough. I tried to get through it about a year or so ago, but got stuck again in the second chapter, although on a different problem. I distinctly remember solving that on my own as a kid, but for the life of me couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
