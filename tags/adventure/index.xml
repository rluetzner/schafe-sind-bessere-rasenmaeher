It starts out as a pretty slow burn, but that&amp;rsquo;s alright for the horror genre. Once it&amp;rsquo;s got it&amp;rsquo;s hooks into you, it becomes really hard to put down. With two kids and a daytime job, I only get a few hours to myself every evening. If not for that, I can guarantee that I would have finished this in a single sitting.</description></item><item><title>Return to Monkey Island (2022)</title><link>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 21:13:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;d ever get: a new Monkey Island from Ron Gilbert. And as expected it fits in perfectly with the first two Monkey Island games.
My first contact with the Monkey Island series was with The Curse of Monkey Island. I did not know at that time that it was the third entry in the series, but I remember enjoying the humor and slapstick. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much further than the second chapter as a kid, although I finished it sometime later with a walkthrough.</description></item></channel></rss>
