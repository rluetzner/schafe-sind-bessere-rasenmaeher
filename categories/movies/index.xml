I&amp;rsquo;m not really picky so anything goes: slashers, elevated horror, ghost flicks, cosmic horror, &amp;hellip;
This year started out with a weird urge to rewatch all the Friday the 13th movies. I looked up the entire franchise and couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember if I had seen the latest reboot. I&amp;rsquo;m honestly still not quite sure, but I thiiiiink I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it once before, so this marks my second go through all of these horrible movies.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade (2018)</title><link>/posts/upgrade-2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 22:31:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/upgrade-2018/</guid><description>Someone wrote in to mention this movie in one of the latest WOFF dispatch episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve heard. Whoever wrote in compared it to Venom and that is actually spot on. This movie is also brilliant.
A violent mugging leaves a mechanic as a quadroplegic and without a wife. He decides to go through with an experimental operation that will implant STEM, an AI that can control his body into his spine.</description></item><item><title>As Above, So Below (2014)</title><link>/posts/as-above-so-below-2014/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 21:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/as-above-so-below-2014/</guid><description>Just because I watched The Descent yesterday and it reminded me of this movie, I had to watch it again. I could remember almost nothing about this and was quite surprised at the Tomb Raider-esque treasure hunting setup.
The Descent&amp;rsquo;s setup feels a bit more natural, as does most of that movie. As Above, So Below is a found footage type movie, which I also completely forgot. It is more a gimmick than strictly necessary for any scares or suspense.</description></item><item><title>The Descent (2005)</title><link>/posts/the-descent-2005/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 21:02:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-descent-2005/</guid><description>This is a de(s)cent movie! üòÅ
I always get this mixed up with As Above, So Below, mostly because I know that both movies take place in caves. Whereas I had seen As Above, So Below before, The Descent was a new experience for me.
The film tells the story of an all female group of friends that go caving together. During the trip they find out that they are not as close knit friends as they thought they were.</description></item></channel></rss>
