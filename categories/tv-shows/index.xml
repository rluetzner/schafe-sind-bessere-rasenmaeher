This contains heavy spoilers for the tv show.
Actually, I would say that knowing almost anything about this is a spoiler. So if you think you might like this, give it a go and come back once you&amp;rsquo;ve watched it! ðŸ™‚
These six one-hour episodes are a wild ride that is worth experiencing. And they are worth being experienced without any prior knowledge.
The main focus of this show is Lucy Chambers, a single mom with a kid that is seemingly plagued by schizophrenia and is suffering from some type of autism.</description></item></channel></rss>
