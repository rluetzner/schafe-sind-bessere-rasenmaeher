One of these words is &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Mitgef√ºhl&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; compassion. However, if you split it into it&amp;rsquo;s constituent words and translate them, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with &amp;ldquo;with feeling&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; as in togetherness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a sense, from the words that make up &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Mitgef√ºhl&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;s much closer to &lt;em>empathy&lt;/em>, even if we Germans do not use it that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generally, being compassionate and empathic are considered good traits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The magic of being humble</title><link>/mindfulness/the-magic-of-being-humble/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 21:30:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/the-magic-of-being-humble/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a low-level fascination with knots since I was a little kid. Now, ever since I learned the &lt;a href="../tying-shoelaces">Ian Knot&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to look into more knots and try and learn them. I got it in my head today to build new bows for my kids, so of course I first wanted to learn how to tie a knot for a bowstring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if I found the right thing, but I stumbled upon the &lt;a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot">Bowline Knot&lt;/a>. I found a guide on &lt;a href="https://www.animatedknots.com">https://www.animatedknots.com&lt;/a> and pretty much got stuck on the site for the rest of the day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old habits die hard #1</title><link>/mindfulness/old-habits-die-hard-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 22:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/old-habits-die-hard-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright people! Time for the nitty-gritty!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My last few posts might have made me seem like a Zen-master, so get ready for the truth! üòÖ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is meant to be an objective retrospective of how I&amp;rsquo;m doing on my way to being more mindful. As objective as I can be about myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are however a few problems with this approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most obvious one being, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t defined any goals I want to reach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Positive Phrasing</title><link>/mindfulness/positive-phrasing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 21:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/positive-phrasing/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Ah fuck, I still need to put the dishes into the dishwasher.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Man, I hate these meetings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Kill me already. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of something my boss told me a few years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The product I was working on at that time was &lt;strong>legacy code&lt;/strong> (queue scary sound effects). Horrible, messy code that was written more than two decades ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One component in particular was &lt;em>the&lt;/em> text book example of all the worst practices you can think of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A blast from the past</title><link>/mindfulness/a-blast-from-the-past/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/a-blast-from-the-past/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still reading &lt;em>Reconciliation: Healing the inner child&lt;/em> by Thich Nhat Hanh and trying to slowly adjust my day-to-day habits to be more mindful. The latest exercise I tried was meditating and talking to my 5-year old self.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t meditated in a while and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at visualization techniques. Both very good reasons to give it a try. So I sat down yesterday for ten minutes and tried to establish contact to a 5-year old version of myself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being centered - physically and temporally</title><link>/mindfulness/being-centered-physically-and-temporally/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 19:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/being-centered-physically-and-temporally/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve always interpreted &lt;em>being centered&lt;/em> as something mostly physical. A strong stance. Nobody can shake you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also some mental aspects to it: feeling confident, having full acceptance of your strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But one aspect never popped up until now: being centered temporally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not thinking about what happened yesterday, or even in the conversation you had just now. Also not thinking ahead to what needs to be done tomorrow or worrying about things in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tying shoelaces</title><link>/mindfulness/tying-shoelaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 19:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/tying-shoelaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to be more mindful during the day and keep my focus on the task at hand. Whenever I catch my thoughts wandering off, I gently pull them back into the present moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;aside>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s going great. I just spilt a glass of water while setting up the laptop for this post, because I was pondering what to write. üòÖ&lt;/p>&lt;/aside>

&lt;p>I (re)started this journey rather recently, &lt;strong>but&lt;/strong> I discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve already been tying my shoelaces mindfully for the last year or so, ever since I learned about the &lt;em>Granny Knot&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
