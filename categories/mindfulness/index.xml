A strong stance. Nobody can shake you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also some mental aspects to it: feeling confident, having full acceptance of your strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But one aspect never popped up until now: being centered temporally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not thinking about what happened yesterday, or even in the conversation you had just now. Also not thinking ahead to what needs to be done tomorrow or worrying about things in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tying shoelaces</title><link>/mindfulness/tying-shoelaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 19:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/mindfulness/tying-shoelaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to be more mindful during the day and keep my focus on the task at hand.

&lt;p>I (re)started this journey rather recently, &lt;strong>but&lt;/strong> I discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve already been tying my shoelaces mindfully for the last year or so, ever since I learned about the &lt;em>Granny Knot&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
