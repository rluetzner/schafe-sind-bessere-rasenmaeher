The test scenario required deploying a cluster of VMs running our product and putting some load on it. After a short outburst from my side (&amp;ldquo;HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT DOCUMENT THE WAY YOU TEST THINGS!?&amp;rdquo;) we got talking about a cool manager like application where we would be able to coordinate multiple clients running different load generators.</description></item><item><title>How I inherited an Open Source project</title><link>/tech/how-i-inherited-an-open-source-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 21:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/how-i-inherited-an-open-source-project/</guid><description>On Monday the 6th February of 2023, I woke up to find a surprising email in my inbox.
An email with the subject RE: Chord Generator What is a Chord Generator?! Let&amp;rsquo;s go back a little in history&amp;hellip;
Back in 2017 I remember talking to my boss at work about GitHub. I mentioned, that I had a GitHub account, but at that time I only had one project uploaded and otherwise not interacted with it.</description></item><item><title>How I accidentally corrupted my WSL virtual disk and what I learned from it</title><link>/tech/corrupted-my-wsl-virtual-disk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:07:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/corrupted-my-wsl-virtual-disk/</guid><description>I love WSL. I mainly develop for Linux systems at work, but for company reasons am forced to use a Windows machine. WSL is the next best thing and I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending almost my entire time the last few years inside this sweet Linux environment.
A few days ago however, I managed to almost destroy my WSL instance. It took me a while to figure out what exactly happened, but here it goes.</description></item><item><title>I toot with the power of cURL</title><link>/tech/i-toot-with-the-power-of-curl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 20:56:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>/tech/i-toot-with-the-power-of-curl/</guid><description>I spent the last two days trying to make a simple script that toots a static message on Mastodon. The idea came to me, because my instance admin is determined to welcome all new users to the instance. He&amp;rsquo;s been using the same message for a while, but when asked he admited that he puts them together manually every time.
As I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with administrating a Mastodon instance, I offered to help in automating the part of the process sending out a welcome toot.</description></item><item><title>Docker builds are not reproducible</title><link>/tech/docker-builds-are-not-reproducible/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 21:30:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tech/docker-builds-are-not-reproducible/</guid><description>TL;DR
If your Docker build depends on installing packages from an external package repository, you might be in for a surprise.
A possible solution is to copy cached layers from an existing machine to a new one.
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably out myself as an absolute idiot, but Docker builds are far from reproducible.
Recently I had to setup a new Jenkins node at work and to verify that everything works correctly, I ran our build process.</description></item></channel></rss>
