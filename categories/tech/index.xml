I mainly develop for Linux systems at work, but for company reasons am forced to use a Windows machine. WSL is the next best thing and I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending almost my entire time the last few years inside this sweet Linux environment.
A few days ago however, I managed to almost destroy my WSL instance. It took me a while to figure out what exactly happened, but here it goes.</description></item><item><title>I toot with the power of cURL</title><link>https://www.schafe-sind-bessere-rasenmaeher.de/tech/i-toot-with-the-power-of-curl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 20:56:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.schafe-sind-bessere-rasenmaeher.de/tech/i-toot-with-the-power-of-curl/</guid><description>I spent the last two days trying to make a simple script that toots a static message on Mastodon.

If your Docker build depends on installing packages from an external package repository, you might be in for a surprise.
A possible solution is to copy cached layers from an existing machine to a new one.
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably out myself as an absolute idiot, but Docker builds are far from reproducible.
Recently I had to setup a new Jenkins node at work and to verify that everything works correctly, I ran our build process.</description></item></channel></rss>
