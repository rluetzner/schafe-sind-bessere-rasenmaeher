<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=/tags/mindfulness>mindfulness</a><br><b>Estimated reading time: </b>5 minutes<article><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve published anything on this site. Every now and then an idea pops into my head that sparks a flame of excitement. Sadly these don&rsquo;t last long enough for me to sit down and actually write them out.</p><p>I have tons of ideas in my notes, but the excitement often leaves me once I&rsquo;ve written down a few words as a reminder.</p><p>Part of it is, that so many of these things have been said before, often by people that are much better wordsmiths than I am. But another big part of it is that I&rsquo;m really exhausted.</p><p>For a while sitting down to blog was a way to replenish my energy. I assume this would come back with a bit of practice and regularity.</p><p>But right now I feel like doing other things.</p><p>I was about to delete this post again, but I had a quick look at my blog ideas and discovered something interesting.</p><blockquote><p>finding a way vs. Finding obstacles</p></blockquote><p>This was one of the ideas that I woke up with one morning and decided it would be interesting to think through.</p><h2 id=at-work>At work</h2><p>I noticed that when I&rsquo;m in <em>at work</em> mode, I rarely get discouraged by things that get in my way. I write software for a living and while there are certain hard limits, you can usually achieve whatever you want if you try long and hard enough.</p><p>I&rsquo;m usually the one to pick tasks that nobody else wants. I don&rsquo;t care if I have to bang my head against a wall for a few hours or days, because I usually learn something interesting from it. I&rsquo;m a Jack of all trades and I don&rsquo;t mind being a master of none, because I like learning about and discovering new things.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m good at it. It took me years to figure that out and even longer to be able to say it out loud. I am a good multi-tool.</p><h2 id=at-home>At home</h2><p>However, when I&rsquo;m not at work, I tend to put everything off until the very last minute. Instead of plunging head first into action, I actively seek out any obstacles, no matter how small, to keep me from getting into gear.</p><p>It took me <strong>over a year</strong> to finally mount a board on the kitchen wall.</p><p>And that was purely the act of mounting it, we had the board and screws and all the other parts necessary.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Aaaaah&mldr;you know I have to drill holes in the wall, so I can&rsquo;t do it after work. It&rsquo;ll be too late and annoy the neighbours.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Well I can&rsquo;t do it this weekend, obviously. We already have other plans and besides I&rsquo;m exhausted from working all week.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Yeah, I know I&rsquo;ve been on vacation for a while now, but I still need to drill the holes and you know the kids don&rsquo;t like loud noise and the weather outside and&mldr;&rdquo;</em></p><h2 id=why-where-does-this-come-from>Why? Where does this come from?</h2><blockquote><p>Robert at work 8h a day: <em>&ldquo;Sure, no problem. I can get it done.&rdquo;</em><br>Robert at home: <em>&ldquo;Aaaaah, it&rsquo;ll have to wait until tomorrow.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>Seeing it like that, it&rsquo;s really bugging me. Where does this come from? Why do I act so differently?</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s not that I think things are hard.</strong> Drilling holes and putting up boards is super easy. It <strong>did</strong> take longer than the 5 minutes I expected, but it still was finished very quickly.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s also not that things are less rewardning.</strong> If anything, getting shit done at work can feel much less rewarding. I often put in loads of effort to get things done quickly, just to see them float around unused for months. In contrast to that, I felt an immediate sense of accomplishment once the board was up and I see it every day and smile a little.</p><p><strong>Maybe it&rsquo;s having a deadline?</strong> I don&rsquo;t know. Setting arbitrary deadlines in my private life feels&mldr;wrong somehow. And as I mentioned just now, having a deadline at work can be utterly meaningless, if the new feature remains unused for months.</p><p><strong>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s exhaustion</strong>, because I feel exhausted no matter if I am at work or not.</p><p><strong>Might be the people depending on me</strong>, although I&rsquo;m a bit unhappy with the idea. I&rsquo;m quick to say <em>yes</em> and I rarely say <em>no</em> to requests. There is a chance that I just don&rsquo;t want to disappoint people. But then again, my wife asked me to mount the board in the kitchen and I had no problem letting that slip for a year. We&rsquo;re getting into dangerous thoughts territory here. She <em>should</em> be the person I want to disappoint the least (other than my kids), but I might have tempered her expectations a bit already. <strong>Am I okay with putting my wife on hold?</strong></p><p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s much simpler. <strong>I love tinkering with software and code, but I&rsquo;m not a good handyman.</strong> Also some flaws there, because I also like writing and I haven&rsquo;t written in two months. I also enjoyed practicing Taiji, but stopped almost three years ago and at least for the moment I have no intentions of picking it back up again.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to solve this and I actually don&rsquo;t even think that this is something that needs to be solved.</p><p>The important thing is that any boards that need mounting get mounted eventually.</p><hr><p>Did you like what you read?
