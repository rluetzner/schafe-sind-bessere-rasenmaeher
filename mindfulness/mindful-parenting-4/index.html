I&rsquo;m not deliberately trying to be more careful, but whenever I can I try to keep myself in the moment.</p><p>An easy example that comes to mind is: &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t this budging!? Maybe if I apply more force, it&rsquo;ll&mldr;well, shit&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Now, when I notice that something is stuck, I pause, tug at it in a few different directions to determine where the resistance is coming from and then carefully work around the resistance.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m also enjoying things more. The book <em>Reconciliation: Healing the inner child</em> by Thich Nhat Hanh that I&rsquo;m currently reading mentions doing things mindfully versus letting the subconscious take over<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>You can get pretty far by going on auto-pilot, but things will never be 100% exactly the same. I tend to do things fast and often kinda <em>throw</em> stuff, instead of placing it carefully, so every now and then I&rsquo;ll miss a move and my subconscious will violently pull me into the present moment to fix things &ndash; or more often, just watch helplessly as something plummets to it&rsquo;s inevitable doom.</p><p>Not to say that I constantly break stuff, but I&rsquo;ve noticed a few occasions already where I would have applied the wrong kind of force.</p><h2 id=consuming-less-media>Consuming less media</h2><p>Staying in the moment in particular means <strong>no distractions</strong>. So I haven&rsquo;t listened to any podcasts or music and I also try (still struggling a bit) to limit scrolling through my Mastodon timeline to times where I&rsquo;m not supposed to do something else.</p><p>The thought that <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m falling behind on my podcasts&rdquo;</em> has come up, but <strong>it didn&rsquo;t bother me</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also had little time to play videogames, but I&rsquo;m okay with that too.</p><p>Overall I no longer feel that I need to push myself to get household chores done as quickly as possible (and <em>break</em> things). Instead I take my time and try to find some enjoyment in the activities.</p><p>Despite my initial scepticism, I usually do indeed find something.</p><h2 id=reconnecting-with-my-body>Reconnecting with my body</h2><p>Until about 2.5 years ago, I was a Taiji student. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I did indeed develop a certain awareness for how my body moves and what I could do better to make the movements healthier.</p><p>I stopped going to practice when my second kid was born and I haven&rsquo;t practiced the Taiji moveset for myself more than five times since. I&rsquo;m not even sure if I could reconstruct the entire sequence from memory without some guidance.</p><p>Having said all that, I noticed that I can still tap into this awareness, when I&rsquo;m moving deliberately. Keeping myself in the moment also applies to times where I&rsquo;m &ldquo;just walking&rdquo;. Around the flat, down the stairs, along a gravel road.</p><p>While I am overweight and very out of shape, I can push myself to do a lot of things. I bike to work every day, try to climb stairs whenever I can, go hiking, help friends move. I&rsquo;d like to think that I can still do everything any average person can accomplish.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the last few years I have started to feel my weight (and probably also my age). My knees hurt, my back hurts, I have some weird blockade in my right wrist.</p><p>Now, being more mindful when I&rsquo;m moving helps me adjust my steps ever so slightly, so that I align my knees properly before putting weight on them. The pain is still there, but it&rsquo;s getting better.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also another surprising development: I stopped over-eating.
Especially in the last few weeks, where my stress levels were at a constant all-time high, I noticed that I was continuously craving food. I would eat any left-overs after dinners, scavenge the fridge late in the evening and snack whatever and whenever I could.</p><p>It just stopped.</p><p>I actually had a few evenings where I didn&rsquo;t eat dinner at all. I was still full from a light afternoon snack (or maybe even lunch).</p><p>Previously throwing left-over food away &ndash; especially the tasty unhealthy kind &ndash; felt <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>It still feels wasteful to throw food away, but I no longer feel the unreasonable urge to put it in my body.</p><h2 id=staying-calm>Staying calm</h2><p>My main goal: how can I stay calm when my kids are driving me fucKING UP THEWaLL!!!!!111!</p><p>I was never big into <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>, a roguelike tactics videogame. However, the game has a <em>stress</em> mechanic that I could relate to very well.</p><p>When you spend too much time crawling through dungeons in the dark and getting attacked by weird monsters, the stress level of each character rises until it hits a breaking point. And then&mldr;</p><p><figure><img src=dd-failed.webp alt="A character from Darkest Dungeon has hit their breaking point and is hit with the &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; affliction.

The character&rsquo;s face is distorted by a grimace of pain. The person is outlined in a deep red.</figcaption></figure></p><p>At least this is what usually happens. However, there&rsquo;s a very small stat-based chance that characters will instead prevail and get a second wind.</p><p><figure><img src=dd-resolved.webp alt="A character from Darkest Dungeon has hit their breaking point and prevailed. They have a glowing golden outline and are now &ldquo;focused&rdquo;."><figcaption>A character from Darkest Dungeon has hit their breaking point and prevailed. They have a glowing golden outline and are now &ldquo;focused&rdquo;.</figcaption></figure></p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed something very similar happen to me. At least in the last few weeks I failed my stat check every single time and would go into a shouting rage when I reached my breaking point. Prior to that I&rsquo;ve had a few occasions where I noticed I was fast approaching the point of no return and managed to swerve into <em>epic parenting mode</em> at just the right moment. I would then calmly address my kids and defuse the situation.</p><p>As it turns out, I can just trigger this. And by accident I&rsquo;ve also just written down why. If I&rsquo;m aware that I&rsquo;m about to blow my top, I can steel myself and get ready to draw a very long and deep breath. Being mindful in the moment immediately unlocked this for me.</p><h2 id=bonus-tackling-my-fears>Bonus: tackling my fears</h2><p>I am afraid of heights. It&rsquo;s also triggered by very specific things, not all of which I understand.</p><p>One thing that&rsquo;ll trigger me is when the guard rails are too low. I noticed this when I was in the very first row on the second floor of a church during a sermon.</p><p>Another thing is watching the floor approach slowly. I very vividly remember riding down the elevator on the Eiffel tower and nearly breaking my then-girlfriend in half, because I had nothing else to hold on to.</p><p>Walking along the edge of the cliffs of Moher felt perfectly fine, while walking on a narrow ledge along the Swiss Alps made my heart beat so fast that I thought it&rsquo;d give out then and there.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge I haven&rsquo;t always had this fear. I can think of one very specific moment where this might have formed, though.</p><p>When I was 11 or 12, I spent a short time living in a small village called Lonsingen on the Swabian Alps. Me and my friends would dick around in the streets or in the nearby forest.</p><p>The forest was forbidden &ndash; it belonged to a farmer in the village and was securely cordoned off with a barbed wire fence. That didn&rsquo;t stop us of course.</p><p>One day, we decided to climb one of the huge trees. I guess it was a fir tree. Something with low hanging branches that were easy to climb.</p><p>My memory is a bit hazy, so I might be overestimating the size a bit. I&rsquo;m somewhat sure that it was at least as high as a three-story building. We must have been at least 10 meters up.</p><p>My friend stopped climbing somewhere in the middle, but I pushed on until I was pretty close to the treetop. The view was amazing. I can still recall holding on to the tree trunk up there, gently swaying in the wind.</p><p>I started making my way back down again. I climbed steadily, because branches were pretty evenly spaced.</p><p>Suddenly however, my feet dropped away and were dangling freely below me. I was gripping on to the branch above me for dear life, frantically trying to find a branch to step onto &ndash; but there was nothing there.</p><p>Eventually my strength gave out and I dropped &ndash;</p><p>Right onto a thick branch that must have been just a few centimeters out of reach. I landed on it perfectly and had all the sense in the world to throw my wobbly arms around the tree trunk and grab on until the shaking stopped.</p><p>Sorry for taking such a long trip down memory lane. I kinda like that story. I was such a stupid kid and it&rsquo;s honestly a major miracle that I&rsquo;m still alive today.</p><p>Getting back to today&mldr;</p><p><figure><img src=cable-car.webp alt="Photo taken while riding a cable car. Lots of trees seen from pretty high up."><figcaption>Photo taken while riding a cable car. Lots of trees seen from pretty high up.</figcaption></figure></p><p>In particular this is the longest cable car ride of this specific type in Germany, the <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schauinslandbahn>Schauinslandbahn</a>. I&rsquo;ve ridden this beast a few times, but I always forget that I get vertigo at a certain point.</p><p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured out exactly what causes it, because I usually don&rsquo;t get vertigo when I am inside a cable car and I feel perfectly fine 80% of the ride up and down. The car wasn&rsquo;t even shaking that much.</p><p>Nevertheless, pretty much out of nowhere and with no warning signs I was hit with extreme vertigo. Cold sweat formed on my forehead, my breath was going rugged and I could feel the skin in my hand being stretched by gripping the handholds so hard. I had to close my eyes and started shaking all over.</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>And then another.</p><p>And then I accepted my fear.</p><p>I was never ashamed of my fear of heights. It&rsquo;s not that kind of acceptance. It&rsquo;s rather <em>I accept that I&rsquo;m feeling fear right now &ndash; and it&rsquo;s perfectly fine</em>.</p><p>And just as suddenly I was calm again.</p><p>My breath slowed down and eventually I could open my eyes again and enjoy the view of the distant mountains of the Vosges in France.</p><h2 id=what-now>What now?</h2><p>This has been an amazing week so far. I haven&rsquo;t even changed my behavior that much, but my mind is blown by the effects I&rsquo;ve observed.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still a bit wary though, because I&rsquo;ve just returned from a week of family vacation on a remote farm and I&rsquo;ve managed to eke out a few more vacation days from work. So, I&rsquo;m not at my usual stress levels and not context switching as wildly as I usually do.</p><p>The real exam will be next week when I&rsquo;ll be back to juggling work and family life &ndash; especially when I&rsquo;m working from home in the afternoons.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The book uses the term <em>store consciousness</em> meaning habits stored in memory (I guess).
