Time for the nitty-gritty!</p><p>My last few posts might have made me seem like a Zen-master, so get ready for the truth! ðŸ˜…</p><p>This is meant to be an objective retrospective of how I&rsquo;m doing on my way to being more mindful. As objective as I can be about myself.</p><p>There are however a few problems with this approach.</p><p>The most obvious one being, that I haven&rsquo;t defined any goals I want to reach.</p><div class=toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#no-goals>No goals?</a></li><li><a href=#positive-phrasing>Positive phrasing</a></li><li><a href=#finding-joy-in-mundane-things>Finding joy in mundane things</a></li><li><a href=#battling-fomo--deliberate-media-consumption>Battling FOMO / Deliberate media consumption</a></li><li><a href=#getting-angryat-my-kids>Getting angry&mldr;at my kids</a></li><li><a href=#listening-to-my-body>Listening to my body</a></li><li><a href=#meditating>Meditating</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div><h2 id=no-goals>No goals?</h2><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve mainly followed the advice <strong>focus on the present moment</strong> and observed a bunch of positive changes that come with my interpretation of that.</p><p>Maybe somewhere down the line I&rsquo;ll define proper goals for these topics, but so far I&rsquo;m pretty happy with <em>staying in the moment</em> and I&rsquo;ll just assume that these benefits will come and stay naturally.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s put this down as <strong>&ldquo;the journey is it&rsquo;s own reward.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2 id=positive-phrasing>Positive phrasing</h2><p>This is somewhat of a prerequisite for the next topic <em>finding joy in mundane things</em>. Of course it also becomes easier to keep a positive perspective, if you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself more.</p><p>Things are going&mldr;okay. Staying positive was pretty easy as long as I was on vacation, but it&rsquo;s gotten harder once I returned to work.</p><p>I still manage it most of the time, but there are occasions, where I&rsquo;d just rather sit down and <strong>rest</strong>. I don&rsquo;t think needing rest actually violates this principle, but it does put a limit on my positivity.</p><h2 id=finding-joy-in-mundane-things>Finding joy in mundane things</h2><p>This was the most obvious benefit, when I started keeping my mind right here and now.</p><p><strong>Household chores were suddenly kinda &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. Getting something done also felt like a significant accomplishment and gave me an intense mood boost.</strong></p><p>Still works like a charm&mldr;given that I&rsquo;ve managed to motivate myself to get started.</p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve become unsure if I&rsquo;m actually doing things <em>joyfully</em> or rather just <em>pushing on</em>, because nobody else would take care of it.</p><p><strong><em>Pushing on / pushing through</em> feels absolutely wrong. It&rsquo;s mentally draining.</strong></p><p>Once I noticed this pattern, it was like an alarm bell went off inside of me. The <em>&ldquo;argh, I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;</em> mentality is part of what pushed me into the deep hole of physical and mental exhaustion I&rsquo;ve mostly managed to crawl out of in the last few weeks.</p><h2 id=battling-fomo--deliberate-media-consumption>Battling FOMO / Deliberate media consumption</h2><p>I associate <em>fear of missing out</em> mostly with videogames, movies and TV shows and particularly the feeling of <em>not being able to join in on the discussion</em>.</p><p>FOMO is of course a much <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out>broader topic</a>, but missing out on media is honestly the only part that affects me. Otherwise I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my life choices. I have a few memories of things I&rsquo;d rather have done differently &ndash; some of which I want to write about in the future &ndash; but these things are in the past and I can&rsquo;t change them. I don&rsquo;t tend to dwell on these.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve mostly managed to quiet the part of me that felt bad whenever I couldn&rsquo;t squeeze in time for media of any kind. That may sound laughable to some of you, but it put a real damper on my mood when I didn&rsquo;t manage to fit podcasts, games, movies or TV shows into my day.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t spend <em>any</em> time with media, but I chose these moments more deliberately.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m in control and can choose how and with which kind of media I want to interact.</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s give a proper example. I know I&rsquo;ve started a whole bunch of videogames, most of which I do intend to continue at one point or another. But right now I&rsquo;m in the mood for some <em>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines</em>.</p><p>Previously I&rsquo;d also put on headphones whenever I was stuck with a chore for more than a minute, but now I spend a lot of quiet time folding the laundry, taking care of the dishes or taking out the garbage.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t strictly adhere to <em>staying in the present</em> every single moment. <strong>I do allow my thoughts to wander, because one pretty obvious thing about having some quiet time is, you&rsquo;re spending time with your own thoughts.</strong> Kinda like meditating.</p><p>I do most things on auto-pilot, but even so I&rsquo;ve noticed that having my mind wander is very different from paying attention to a podcast on the side. I can find my way back to the present moment much easier if there&rsquo;s something that needs my immediate attention.</p><h2 id=getting-angryat-my-kids>Getting angry&mldr;at my kids</h2><p>The initial problem I wanted to tackle when I started down the mindfulness road.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to think that things have gotten better, but I&rsquo;m still struggling. Especially when I get stressed. Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t stress out in the first place, but sometimes even the present moment has enough worries to break me.</p><p>I think I do rather well, as long as I can keep to myself. But as soon as people start pushing me (e.g. <em>&ldquo;Dad, where&rsquo;s my apply already?&rdquo;</em>), my concentration starts to crumble.</p><h2 id=listening-to-my-body>Listening to my body</h2><p>Once I started paying more attention to the current moment, I pretty much stopped overeating.</p><p>While that was easier on vacation, where I could have a proper breakfast, I still kinda keep it up at home. There are days when I have to skip breakfast to make things work in the morning, so I&rsquo;ll fast and eat more at lunch. But overall I&rsquo;m apparently still slowly loosing weight.</p><p>Another very simple thing I noticed is that I no longer hop around like an idiot when I try to put on my socks and trousers every morning.</p><p><strong>I once thought that my balance improved by doing Taiji, but as it turns out you just need to pay attention when you&rsquo;re doing things.</strong></p><p>Then again&mldr;earlier today I felt extremely tired.</p><p>Like I would fall asleep every time I blinked.</p><p>Even though I was riding a bike in traffic at the moment.</p><p>And now I&rsquo;m writing a blog post at 22:30, so make of that what you will. ðŸ˜¬</p><h2 id=meditating>Meditating</h2><p>My Taiji teacher used to quote</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Everybody should meditate at least ten minutes a day.<br>Except for people that don&rsquo;t have ten minutes.<br>They should meditate for an hour.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Apparently it&rsquo;s an old Zen saying and the durations vary wildly.</p><p>It&rsquo;s become one of my favorite quotes&mldr;even though I don&rsquo;t manage to actually live by it.</p><p>I managed to sit down in meditation twice in the last weeks, so it&rsquo;s nowhere near a daily habit. Nevertheless, both times were amazing experiences.</p><p>I used to meditate according to specific guidelines in the past (check in with your body, focus on the breathing). The last two times I sat down and started out with a specific exercise (focus on the breath / conjure up your five year old self), but then I let my mind flow where it wanted to go.</p><p><strong>It felt like I had kept my thoughts chained up for far too long.</strong></p><p>Some long forgotten memories have bubbled up again; some painful, some happy. As my thoughts were flowing they also washed a few insights ashore. I can&rsquo;t recall anything specific right now, but I somehow felt&mldr;wiser after meditating.</p><p>I definitely want to make more time for meditation.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>So that&rsquo;s that.</p><p>Reading through what I wrote, I&rsquo;m actually pretty satisfied with where I am. Which sounds and feels in tune with the principles I want to apply to my life.</p><p>Let me know how things are going on your end. ðŸ™‚</p></article><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ href=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text property="dct:title" rel=dct:type><i>One step at a time #1</i></span> written by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=/mindfulness/one-step-at-a-time-1/ property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionURL>Robert LÃ¼tzner</a> is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</main><footer><p>Â© 2024 Robert LÃ¼tzner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
