Next to the restaurant was a playground with a small wooden locomotive.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Molly&rdquo;, my older son proclaimed as he sat behind the steering wheel. His younger brother of course playing along as a passenger.</p><p>We&rsquo;re reading Jim Button together, so I immediately knew what he was talking about. He also kinda addressed a nearby mom, who looked very confused. I explained that it&rsquo;s the little locomotive from Jim Button.</p><p>&ldquo;Aha&rdquo;, the mom replied with a <em>why-are-you-talking-to-me</em> expression. &ldquo;I only know Emma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Molly only turns up in the second book&rdquo;, I continued unapologetically.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>The mom left quickly afterwards.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, help me up on the roof. I need to look for the magnetic mountain.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Once he was on the roof, he started crawling around. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m Nepomuk<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. I need to guard the magnetic mountain and make sure it&rsquo;s switched on and off.&rdquo;</p><p>I was quite impressed at the way he narrated what he was doing. And immensely happy that we had built up this context together.</p><p>A few minutes later a tall girl climbed up next to him. I&rsquo;m terrible at guessing the age of kids, but I&rsquo;d say she was probably eight. In grade school at least. Quite a few years older than my 4-year old son.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m already up here&rdquo;, my son said fearlessly.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p><p>&ldquo;So what? There&rsquo;s enough space for the both of us&rdquo;, she answered.</p><p>He was slightly taken aback by her response, but after a short silence he went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nepomuk. And this is Molly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aha&rdquo;, the girl said. She looked at him with mild interest.</p><p>&ldquo;And look over here. This is the magnetic mountain I&rsquo;m switching on and off.&rdquo;</p><p>She leaned over and looked at the back of the locomotive. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll fly us up into the sky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It can fly?&rdquo; She sounded sincerely impressed. There were no further questions.</p><p>I was tempted to explain what he was talking about, but I&rsquo;m glad I kept out of the way. I&rsquo;m not sure if the girl knew about Jim Button, Lukas, Nepomuk, magnetic mountains, Emma, Molly or half-dragons, but it didn&rsquo;t matter in the slightest.</p><p>They played a bit inside that context with my son in the lead and then moved on to climbing the slide backwards, with her leading the way and showing him the ropes.</p><p>As an observer I got a strong feeling of <em>being on the same wavelength</em>. Almost tangible <em>mutual understanding</em>. It made me think of when I met my wife and how I immediately fell in love with her. It was a magical moment.</p><p>I&rsquo;m happy and proud to see him figure out how to make friends. He&rsquo;s still pretty young and due to Covid, he spent a long time isolated from other kids.</p><p>He&rsquo;s mostly friends with the neighbours&rsquo; kids. They get along great and I get the feeling he likes playing with them, but it&rsquo;s more a friendship that <strong>we</strong> made for him, because the kids live next door and are roughly the same age.</p><p>He&rsquo;s got exactly one friend in kindergarten, and that kid was magically drawn to our son. They are also roughly the same age and get along fine. My son will play with other kids too, but when asked for his kindergarten friends, he&rsquo;ll always just mention this one boy.</p><p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I was a bit worried that we somehow messed up with all the Covid isolation and he never learned the intuitive and natural way of making friends.</p><p>As always, I shouldn&rsquo;t have worried.</p><p>Watching this process, I was transported back to my own childhood days. I have a distinct memory of when a kid joined me while I was digging around in the sandbox. I asked &ldquo;wanna be friends?&rdquo; and when they answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, we were. I can&rsquo;t remember their name, face or anything else. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that we never met again, but for that one afternoon we were friends.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s skip the years and years after that where I was overthinking how to be friends.</p><p>There is however one last story I want to tell, from my time at university, where I rediscovered this feeling with what is now one of my best and closest friends.</p><p>We had had a couple of drinks and were on a long walk home through the city at night. I no longer remember how we came to talk about friendship, but &ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;In my opinion&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;friendship can only happen over time. I&rsquo;ve spent well over a decade getting to know my best friend intimately.&rdquo;</p><p>I stopped dead in my tracks. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying we cannot be friends?&rdquo;, I asked. &ldquo;That makes me sad, because even though I&rsquo;ve only known you a few days, I&rsquo;d still call you my friend.&rdquo;</p><p>I can&rsquo;t remember discussing this further, so I guess we moved onto other topics. However, when I met him the next day he said: &ldquo;You know, what you said about friendship yesterday? You are right. I want to call you my friend too.&rdquo;</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I&rsquo;d like to think that he&rsquo;s referencing the books, but it&rsquo;s more likely that he&rsquo;s thinking of the puppet play by the Augsburger Puppenkiste.
