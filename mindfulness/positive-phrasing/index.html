I don&rsquo;t wanna&mldr;&rdquo;</em></p><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reminded of something my boss told me a few years ago.</p><p>The product I was working on at that time was <strong>legacy code</strong> (queue scary sound effects). Horrible, messy code that was written more than two decades ago.</p><p>One component in particular was <em>the</em> text book example of all the worst practices you can think of.</p><p>Thousand lines of code classes? Sure.</p><p>Hundreds of lines of code for methods? You betcha.</p><p>Circular dependencies? Someone made it possible.</p><p>Near infinite inheritance trees, low-level types, one character variable names, outdated comments, misleading method names, parameter hell, unsafe optimizations, long-running flaky end-to-end tests, absolutely no unit tests&mldr;? <strong>We&rsquo;ve got you covered!</strong></p><p>So eventually to brighten our day, we added a ton of memes to our chatbot. Whenever someone would send a message containing the component&rsquo;s name, the bot would post a meme, e.g. an animated GIF of a Stormtrooper with a flamethrower saying &ldquo;KILL IT WITH FIRE!&rdquo;</p><p>One day my boss took me aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s with these memes I see in chat every day?&rdquo;, he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re just a bit of an inside joke. They trigger whenever someone mentions component <em>X</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Then, after a short pause. &ldquo;So &ndash; you think it&rsquo;s a bad application?&rdquo;</p><p>That caught me a bit off guard. &ldquo;Well&mldr;no. I think it&rsquo;s badly written and could use a good cleanup. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad software. It does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You realize that this thing is bringing in the big bucks, right?&rdquo;, he asked. &ldquo;We sell the whole package, but the product only really works because of this one component.&rdquo;</p><p>I actually had <em>not</em> thought about this at all.</p><p>He went on. Not chiding me or anything, but merely stating facts. &ldquo;Have you considered that we&rsquo;re onboarding a bunch of new people and all they learn about this thing that keeps us fed and warm is that we should <em>kill it with fire</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>Again, no. But I was catching on.</p><p>&ldquo;These words have power. Especially if you keep hearing them again and again, day in &ndash; day out.&rdquo;</p><p>I deleted the meme triggers the very same day.</p><aside><p>FYI, the component is still around. It&rsquo;s actually a lot of fun figuring out ways to modernize it without breaking it&rsquo;s current behavior.</p></aside><p>About a week ago, I noticed that I fell into the same habit with other things in my life. I&rsquo;d groan whenever my wife asked me to do <em>yet another thing</em>, I&rsquo;d curse under my breath when stomping up and down the stairs to bring out the trash, etc.</p><p>Being more mindful is my thing now, so I noticed &ndash; and then I decided to stop.</p><p>Whenever I caught myself thinking <em>&ldquo;I hate&mldr;&rdquo;</em>, I stopped myself and said <em>&ldquo;You know what? Give it a chance!&rdquo;</em></p><p>Surprisingly the effects were immediately noticeable. While I won&rsquo;t say that I suddenly started enjoying all the household chores, I have to admit that I at least found <em>some</em> joy in my daily tasks.</p><p>You know what? There&rsquo;s a certain satisfaction in folding the laundry <em>just right</em>.</p><p>I also noticed that I&rsquo;m more social than before. I&rsquo;m no longer trying to duck people and I&rsquo;ve had some really nice conversations.</p><p>Overall, I feel much happier than before.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p><strong>BUT</strong> &ndash; parent&rsquo;s evening in kindergarten has got to be the end boss of that!</p><p>Fuck that! It&rsquo;s boring, it&rsquo;s long, it&rsquo;s people, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable chairs, it&rsquo;s</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>No, wait. That&rsquo;s not where I was going.</p><p>So, as you might have guessed: yesterday was indeed parent&rsquo;s evening in kindergarten.</p><p>I had skipped the last two occasions and it was the beginning of the new kindergarten year, so I convinced myself to go.</p><p>Not only that, but I also convinced myself to give it a chance. To go and <em>try</em> to enjoy it.</p><p>And I kinda did. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t half bad. Sure, I can imagine countless things I&rsquo;d have liked to do more, but it was still okay.</p><p>I sneaked in some mindfulness exercises, mainly focusing on the present and listening intently to what the kindergarten teachers had to say. It wasn&rsquo;t all super interesting, but there were bits and pieces that were new to me.</p><p>There were also a few new parents there and I managed to remember all their names. I even made some small talk and feel a bit more connected to the others now.</p><p>In the end, I offered to stay behind to clean the mugs while the teachers were prepping the room for the kids the next day. It felt like a really good and accomplished evening.</p><p>Words do have a strange intangible power. And I think I&rsquo;ve relearned how to wield them.</p></article><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ href=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text property="dct:title" rel=dct:type><i>Positive Phrasing</i></span> written by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=/mindfulness/positive-phrasing/ property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionURL>Robert Lützner</a> is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</main><footer><p>© 2024 Robert Lützner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
