I just copied the last post as a template and my initial intent was removing everything and starting from scratch. But now as I look through the headers, I think I want to think more deeply about the individual topics.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with a quick brain dump: I&rsquo;ve been very dissatisfied with the last few weeks. Things have been stressful and chaotic. I haven&rsquo;t meditated, I&rsquo;ve lost my temper at least once and I noticed that I&rsquo;m struggling with quite a few of my new habits.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve even joked about renaming this series back to <em>old habits die hard</em>. ðŸ˜…</p><p>But let&rsquo;s step through the topics individually.</p><nav id=TableOfContents></nav><h2 id=positive-phrasing>Positive phrasing</h2><p>This has probably suffered the most in the last few weeks. I&rsquo;ve been swearing and cursing both under my breath or just in my own thoughts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s so weird to me to think <em>&ldquo;I really <strong>hate</strong> this&rdquo;</em>, when in reality there are very few things I actively <strong>hate</strong>. I think of hating as something that requires energy. If you don&rsquo;t uphold this hatred, it becomes a dislike or even just being neutral about something.</p><p>I&rsquo;d love to ban this word from my vocabulary forever, but it sneaks back in when I&rsquo;m not careful.</p><h2 id=finding-joy-in-mundane-things>Finding joy in mundane things</h2><p>As I&rsquo;ve written in older posts, this is closely linked to the previous topic. As I&rsquo;ve been struggling with generally enjoying things, I&rsquo;ve gone back to putting my ear plugs in more regularly.</p><p>My goal was to do one thing at a time, but I very rarely take the time out to actively listen to podcasts and I really do miss this as background noise.</p><p>Sadly this also means that I&rsquo;m paying less attention to what I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing. The fact that someone&rsquo;s always talking also means that there&rsquo;s no chance for <em>meditation on the side</em>.</p><h2 id=battling-fomo--deliberate-media-consumption>Battling FOMO / Deliberate media consumption</h2><p>I think I&rsquo;m overall still in a good place here. After a long draught, I&rsquo;ve seen a cool Humble Bundle with scary games that had me tempted. But after some consideration I closed the tab again and let it go. I don&rsquo;t have time to play the games anyway and we can certainly use the money right now.</p><p>I&rsquo;m less battling FOMO right now, but I do miss playing videogames. I&rsquo;ve had very few moments to myself and I chose to finish watching <em>Bocchi the Rock!</em> instead.</p><p>I often found myself jealously looking at new things coming out that I cannot possibly fit into my schedule. There are much bigger issues in the world and even in my life, that I&rsquo;m annoyed that this minor thing makes me sad&mldr;but it does.</p><blockquote><p><em>Acceptance of sadness triggered&mldr;</em></p></blockquote><p>Weird how I missed that before writing it out like this. It&rsquo;s okay to be sad, even for little things. I didn&rsquo;t even notice that I&rsquo;ve been making it worse by repressing the feeling.</p><h2 id=getting-angryat-my-kids>Getting angry&mldr;at my kids</h2><p>Weirdly enough, the last weeks have been&mldr;okay? I can only remember a single incident where I blew my top and I immediately caught myself and tried to defuse the situation rather than doubling down.</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m mostly annoyed that it was such a stupid situation and totally unnecessary. I was calmly trying to explain to my older son what went wrong and why he got chided. He on the other hand was angry, sad and exhausted. He told me multiple times that he didn&rsquo;t want to listen and ultimately unleashed a primal scream&mldr;which I instantly mirrored back at him.</p><h2 id=listening-to-my-body>Listening to my body</h2><p>I&rsquo;d like to say I listened, but ultimately I just gave my body all the sweets and cake it was craving. I haven&rsquo;t been on a scale yet, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I&rsquo;ve undone any progress of the last months.</p><p>I also noticed that I&rsquo;m spending more time mindlessly tapping away at my phone. I scroll through my Fedi timeline and when I&rsquo;m done I look at any news on my RSS reader and then I go back to Fedi. Oftentimes I switch between both apps, even though I&rsquo;ve just exhausted both of them.</p><p>Every now and then I think about picking up a book, but so far I haven&rsquo;t done so. Part of it is, that I don&rsquo;t really want to read any <em>heavy</em> stuff like <em>Reconciliation</em>. I&rsquo;m also two thirds of the way through Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s <em>For the win</em>, which I&rsquo;ve enjoyed so far, but it also comments on societal issues I really don&rsquo;t want to deal with right now.</p><p>And I kinda feel bad starting yet another book, but maybe that would be the way to go. I still haven&rsquo;t read any Terry Pratchett and now feels like a good time to start.</p><h2 id=meditating>Meditating</h2><p>Yet another way in which I haven&rsquo;t been listening to my body. I&rsquo;ve had multiple occasions for a few calm minutes, but I&rsquo;ve ignored all of them for some mindless phone tapping.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I&rsquo;m glad I kept all the headers in and reflected on all topics individually. I started out with a severe sense of disappointment, but after writing everything out I feel like I&rsquo;m doing okay.</p><p>Not all weeks can be winners and at least now I have some clear steps to pursue.</p><ul><li>Do not ignore feelings that bubble up.</li><li>Find a Terry Pratchett book to read. I found a flowchart for <a href=https://mediachomp.com/which-discworld-novel-should-i-start-with-flowchart/>which Discworld novel should I start with</a> a while back. Let&rsquo;s go!</li><li>Put the phone in another room. Or just throw it in the pond.</li></ul><p>Let me know how things are going on your end. ðŸ™‚</p></article><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ href=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text property="dct:title" rel=dct:type><i>One step at a time #3</i></span> written by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=/mindfulness/one-step-at-a-time-3/ property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionURL>Robert LÃ¼tzner</a> is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</main><footer><p>Â© 2024 Robert LÃ¼tzner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
