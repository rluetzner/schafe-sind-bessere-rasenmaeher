And I&rsquo;m not even talking about drugs, but rather movies, TV shows or video games.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of all these things and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with spending a relaxed evening in front of the TV. I&rsquo;d go as far as to say there&rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with spending a whole week with a captivating video game.</p><p>Addiction is surely a big problem, but that&rsquo;s not what I want to talk about. At least that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s giving me trouble.</p><p>Instead, I eventually fall into the rhythm of treating things as checkbox items. Something that needs to be cleared off of a list. My fun free time activities become &ndash; more work!</p><p><em>&ldquo;I loved Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul has been out for years now and I still haven&rsquo;t started season 2 yet.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Depending on the day you ask me, I&rsquo;d say that Dark Souls is my favorite video game. I&rsquo;ve been with the series since the original Demon&rsquo;s Souls &ndash; but I still haven&rsquo;t beaten Elden Ring.&rdquo;</em></p><p>These kind of thoughts often go through my head. Especially in the evenings, when the flat finally quiets down, all the household chores are done and I&rsquo;m finally free to &ndash; <em>get to work!</em></p><p>But which item should I check off the list? An episode of <em>Better Call Saul</em> is about 50 minutes. That&rsquo;s just slightly too long for two episodes in a row, but I also don&rsquo;t want to do two things.</p><p>I could pick up where I left off in <em>Elden Ring</em>, but firing that up for just an hour and a half feels like a waste of time. I&rsquo;ll just be wandering around senselessly, getting killed every now and then. And what the fuck was I doing three weeks ago anyway!?</p><p>I&rsquo;m suffering from choice paralysis, but also stress and anxiety because I feel like I&rsquo;m lagging behind. When I eventually decide on something I want to pursue, I try to do as much as possible and end up going to bed too late. My kids show no mercy and <strong>will</strong> wake me up no matter if I&rsquo;ve slept 7, 8 or 5 hours.</p><p>Nevertheless, when anybody asks me what I want more of, I answer &ldquo;me time!&rdquo; And what I mean with that is: &ldquo;I want to game! I want to just sit down and watch a show! I haven&rsquo;t watched a movie from start to finish in ages!&rdquo;</p><p>Reading through <em>Reconciliation: Healing the inner child</em> by Thich Nhat Hanh I felt the small tingling of an epiphany. I think my mind and body are indeed trying to tell me something. I really do want more <em>me time</em>, but it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to reject things that cause me stress in my free time.</p><p>What I should be doing instead is <strong>pause</strong>.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve actually already done a few healthy adjustments, even before I started reading the book.</p><p><em>Better Call Saul</em> still pops up on my &ldquo;Up next&rdquo; list in Jellyfin, but it&rsquo;s now next to the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> Nickelodeon series from 2012. I loved that show and never finished it. Episodes are just 20 minutes and usually pretty fun, self-contained and fast paced. I can start and stop whenever I want.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve abandoned the idea of finishing <em>Elden Ring</em> anytime soon, but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying <em>Mario&rsquo;s Picross</em> instead lately. I&rsquo;m playing that for the first time. I also went back and finally finished <em>Metroid Prime</em> as well as started replaying the <em>Blackwell</em> point and click adventures. I&rsquo;m currently stuck in <em>Blackwell Convergence</em>, part three of a series of five games. They&rsquo;re good!</p><p>In both cases I&rsquo;m enjoying something nostalgic. Retro games or a show that I&rsquo;ve watched about a decade ago. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what drew me to them, but I do feel that they are healthier in that I don&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;bad&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m not playing the games or watching the show. I&rsquo;m not <em>missing</em> anything.</p><p>This is of course not the same as actually sitting down for a few minutes and taming my rampant thoughts with proper meditation, <strong>but</strong>(!!!) these steps actually freed me up enough to get other things in that I enjoy more.</p><p>Like writing this blog post. Or, you know&mldr;sitting down and meditating. I think it&rsquo;s time to pick this up again.</p></article><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ href=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text property="dct:title" rel=dct:type><i>Ramblings #1 - Unhealthy media consumption</i></span> written by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=/mindfulness/ramblings-1/ property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionURL>Robert Lützner</a> is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</main><footer><p>© 2024 Robert Lützner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
