Once it&rsquo;s got it&rsquo;s hooks into you, it becomes really hard to put down. With two kids and a daytime job, I only get a few hours to myself every evening. If not for that, I can guarantee that I would have finished this in a single sitting.</p><p>The game is roughly 6h long and follows the story of Alan Goldberg, a frustrated slasher movie writer in 1980&rsquo;s Hollywood. He&rsquo;s fed up with writing horror B-movies and wants to get back to the big leagues. An eccentric millionaire is willing to grant him this wish, <strong>if</strong> he can find Edward Kellers lost movie, which is said to be the scariest movie of all time.</p><p>The game can be divided into three acts, all with their own overarching location, theme and feel. The gameplay however stays the same over the course of the game, without any notable deviation from the classic point and click formula. You talk to lots of people, collect a bunch of items and combine them to solve reasonable puzzles. None of the puzzles are too hard and the gameplay mostly gets out of the way to let the story shine. And let me tell you: the story is the absolute highlight of this title. ðŸ¤©</p><p>The first act starts out as a slow burn mystery showing some of the seedy sides of corrupt 1980s Hollywood. Sadly the game doesn&rsquo;t show itself from it&rsquo;s best side here. It takes almost an hour until Edward Keller and his lost movie are finally mentioned. Every bit you learn about Keller however is absolutely riveting. You&rsquo;re drop fed small bits of information and the persona of Keller gets more and more mysterious as the first act progresses.</p><p>The lost movie and it&rsquo;s director vanishing without a trace reminded me strongly of Sutter Kane in <strong>In the Mouth of Madness</strong>, one of my all time favorite horror movies. Go see it, if you haven&rsquo;t done so yet. I&rsquo;m certain that it served as inspiration for the plot. Overall there are lots of references to horror franchises and plots, but <strong>Nightmare Frames</strong> never comes off as a blatant rip-off and rather manages to remix everything into something that feels new, despite the many throwbacks.</p><p>Another reminder of <strong>In the Mouth of Madness</strong> comes with the creepy town in the second act. The mystery is slowly replaced with straight out bone chilling dread. Everything about this town feels wrong. The atmosphere here is very dense with a few well placed jokes that lighten the mood before hitting you with a jump scares that will make you jump. Or at least they did make <em>me</em> jump. ðŸ˜…</p><p>This in turn reminded me of <a href=https://thegamekitchen.com/thelastdoor/><strong>The Last Door</strong></a>, another amazing low-fi point and click you should check out. Incidentally also by a spanish development studio. As far as I can remember that and <strong>Nightmare Frames</strong> are the only pixel-art games that managed to scare me in a way that would stay with me, even after I&rsquo;ve turned off my PC.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything of the third act, but it&rsquo;s&mldr;something else. As a parent, it had one scene &ndash; actually more of a conversation &ndash; that really twisted my insides. Some topics in this game are powerfully uncomfortable, but that is why I seek out horror games and movies. And it is a testament to this writing, that they never feel cheap or forced.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m amazed at how well these three acts blend into each other. There are distinct cuts where the location and with it the type of mystery or horror changes, but there&rsquo;s always a bit of foreshadowing, a small taste of what&rsquo;s to come. I&rsquo;m absolutely planning to steal this plot for a Cthulhu tabletop campaign. ðŸ˜…</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, the graphics are pixel-art, but they are nicely detailed and there were a surprising amount of animations, that helped pull me in despite the low-fi graphics. There are also some amazing mirror and fog effects that I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought possible in AGS. I&rsquo;ve played most of the <em>Wadjet Eye</em> adventures (also heavily recommended) and I remember that they push the AGS engine to it&rsquo;s limits, although I can&rsquo;t remember if they did something similar.</p><p>In addition to the character models on screen, almost all characters in the game have detailed close-ups for dialogue boxes, oftentimes with many different emotions. There is no voiceover whatsoever, but it didn&rsquo;t bother me at all. The music blends in perfectly and helps set the mood.</p><p>I hope I could convice you.
