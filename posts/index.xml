I tend to alternate very heavily between watching movies and tv shows, playing videogames and reading books. This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot of videogames with what little free time I have.
Nevertheless, I do have a candidate for my book of the year 2023: A majom mam√°ja.
The cover for A majom mam√°ja. The book is written by Julia Donaldson, an English writer mostly known for The Gruffalo or Room on the Broom, and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.</description></item><item><title>Helltrain - My favorite band nobody knows</title><link>/posts/helltrain-my-favorite-band-nobody-knows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 10:42:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/helltrain-my-favorite-band-nobody-knows/</guid><description>I initially intended to post a few songs on Mastodon and talk about my history with Helltrain, but I quickly learned that this would be better suited to a blog post. So here we are&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve had Helltrain stuck in my ears for about a week. In particular this morning the chorus to Route 666 was stuck on repeat, so I tortured my kids with a bit of &amp;ldquo;Dad music&amp;rdquo; while prepping breakfast.</description></item><item><title>The day I fell out of love with Lumines...</title><link>/posts/the-day-i-fell-out-of-love-with-lumines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 21:26:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-day-i-fell-out-of-love-with-lumines/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;was yesterday. üòÖ
Even back on the PSP, I always wanted to play Lumines, because it looked like an refreshing tetris-like puzzler to me. For me, this was before digital downloads &amp;ndash; at least PSN downloads, so I never ended up getting it.
But my excitement rekindled when I saw that a Remaster arrived on the Nintendo Switch. And I spent countless hours in Challenge Mode, trying to get to Level 100.</description></item><item><title>Reminiscing About Classic Violent Games</title><link>/posts/reminiscing-about-classic-violent-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 20:49:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/reminiscing-about-classic-violent-games/</guid><description>I had trouble getting to sleep last night and my mind kept returning to games that I&amp;rsquo;d call classic. I was born in 1987, so my definition will most likely differ from yours. Also, after finishing this list I realized that my brain got stuck on violent games. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of classic games left that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about here.
Resident Evil 2 (1998) With the release of Resident Evil 2 Remake, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but enforce the 1998 whenever I mention this game.</description></item><item><title>The Devil's Hour - Season 1 (2022)</title><link>/posts/the-devils-hour-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 20:48:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-devils-hour-2022/</guid><description>Warning!!!
This contains heavy spoilers for the tv show.
Actually, I would say that knowing almost anything about this is a spoiler. So if you think you might like this, give it a go and come back once you&amp;rsquo;ve watched it! üôÇ
These six one-hour episodes are a wild ride that is worth experiencing. And they are worth being experienced without any prior knowledge.
The main focus of this show is Lucy Chambers, a single mom with a kid that is seemingly plagued by schizophrenia and is suffering from some type of autism.</description></item><item><title>Nightmare Frames (2022)</title><link>/posts/nightmare-frames-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 19:42:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/nightmare-frames-2022/</guid><description>Nightmare Frames by Postmodern Adventures might be one of the best Lovecraftian horror games I&amp;rsquo;ve played so far.
It starts out as a pretty slow burn, but that&amp;rsquo;s alright for the horror genre. Once it&amp;rsquo;s got it&amp;rsquo;s hooks into you, it becomes really hard to put down. With two kids and a daytime job, I only get a few hours to myself every evening. If not for that, I can guarantee that I would have finished this in a single sitting.</description></item><item><title>Halloween is coming up</title><link>/posts/halloween-is-coming-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 22:31:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/halloween-is-coming-up/</guid><description>Preamble Every few years when halloween approaches I get the urge to (re)watch a whole bunch of scary movies. I&amp;rsquo;m not really picky so anything goes: slashers, elevated horror, ghost flicks, cosmic horror, &amp;hellip;
This year started out with a weird urge to rewatch all the Friday the 13th movies. I looked up the entire franchise and couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember if I had seen the latest reboot. I&amp;rsquo;m honestly still not quite sure, but I thiiiiink I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it once before, so this marks my second go through all of these horrible movies.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade (2018)</title><link>/posts/upgrade-2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 22:31:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/upgrade-2018/</guid><description>Someone wrote in to mention this movie in one of the latest WOFF dispatch episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve heard. Whoever wrote in compared it to Venom and that is actually spot on. This movie is also brilliant.
A violent mugging leaves a mechanic as a quadroplegic and without a wife. He decides to go through with an experimental operation that will implant STEM, an AI that can control his body into his spine.</description></item><item><title>As Above, So Below (2014)</title><link>/posts/as-above-so-below-2014/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 21:09:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/as-above-so-below-2014/</guid><description>Just because I watched The Descent yesterday and it reminded me of this movie, I had to watch it again. I could remember almost nothing about this and was quite surprised at the Tomb Raider-esque treasure hunting setup.
The Descent&amp;rsquo;s setup feels a bit more natural, as does most of that movie. As Above, So Below is a found footage type movie, which I also completely forgot. It is more a gimmick than strictly necessary for any scares or suspense.</description></item><item><title>The Descent (2005)</title><link>/posts/the-descent-2005/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 21:02:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-descent-2005/</guid><description>This is a de(s)cent movie! üòÅ
I always get this mixed up with As Above, So Below, mostly because I know that both movies take place in caves. Whereas I had seen As Above, So Below before, The Descent was a new experience for me.
The film tells the story of an all female group of friends that go caving together. During the trip they find out that they are not as close knit friends as they thought they were.</description></item><item><title>Unpacking (2021)</title><link>/posts/unpacking-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 22:25:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/unpacking-2021/</guid><description>This is an amazing game with lots of heart. And very relaxing. As the title suggest you&amp;rsquo;re unpacking moving boxes and placing the unpacked items in absolutely beautiful pixel-art rooms.
Coming fresh off of Return to Monkey Island I clicked through the first few stages very quickly. But even so I started placing items more deliberately and grouping matching objects (e.g. books) together. I also quickly noticed recurring items, which the unnamed (and unseen) person keeps between places.</description></item><item><title>Return to Monkey Island (2022)</title><link>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 21:13:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/return-to-monkey-island-2022/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;d ever get: a new Monkey Island from Ron Gilbert. And as expected it fits in perfectly with the first two Monkey Island games.
My first contact with the Monkey Island series was with The Curse of Monkey Island. I did not know at that time that it was the third entry in the series, but I remember enjoying the humor and slapstick. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much further than the second chapter as a kid, although I finished it sometime later with a walkthrough.</description></item></channel></rss>
