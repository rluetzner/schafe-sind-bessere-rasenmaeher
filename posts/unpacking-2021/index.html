<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=tags/indie>indie</a><p>This is an amazing game with lots of heart. And very relaxing. As the title suggest you&rsquo;re unpacking moving boxes and placing the unpacked items in absolutely beautiful pixel-art rooms.</p><p>Coming fresh off of <strong>Return to Monkey Island</strong> I clicked through the first few stages very quickly. But even so I started placing items more deliberately and grouping matching objects (e.g. books) together. I also quickly noticed recurring items, which the unnamed (and unseen) person keeps between places.</p><p>Although there is no explicit story, a lot is told with the environments and objects that you are unpacking. At this point I&rsquo;m going to spoil the entire storyline, because I have to get it out.</p><details><summary>Spoilers!!! Open on your own risk!</summary>
The first stage of the game has you decorating a kids room. There are a lot of toys, books and stuff to place.
In the second stage I started noticing recurring items, most notably the stuffed pig plushy and some early drawings.
The third stage wants you to unpack in an already well equipped and tiny apartment. Right from the start the apartment seems to be well organized and uniform. The stuff I had to unpack earlier was very colorful and often a bit childish. I also started noticing that there were some favorite items, e.g. a cookie jar, that started showing some cracks, but never really went away. The kitchen already contained square plates where I couldn't stack the round plates on top. This won't last girl (you're unpacking bras and panties, so I assume it belongs to a woman).
As expected the fourth stage has you moving back into your old kids room. There is already other stuff, including a sowing machine in there. I accidentally pinned a photo of a couple to the pinboard which I was forced to remove and put into the closet. All the while fittingly melancholic music was playing.
The next stage has you move your stuff into a pretty big apartment. You have lots of space and much freedom to unpack.
The stage after that is the same apartment, but already filled with your stuff and some new furniture. The boxes you're unpacking contain all new items, which also belong to a woman, but compliment the stuff that's already there. It seems like another person is moving in with your main protagonist and it looks like a pretty good match. The now slightly ripped open plushy pig gets a matching tiger companion.
The last stage has you move all that stuff into a gigantic house which contains a little kids room with a crib. In unpacked that room at the very end and got a bit choked up when I saw the pig plushy (now repaired) and could place it in the baby's crib.</details><p>The gameplay is very simplistic, but that is also the point. There is no time limit, no score, no wrong or right. Except for what you might find aesthetically pleasing or not. One the one hand placing items just the right way and ordering stuff is a nice meditation exercise, but on the other hand I was also very surprised at how this game managed to touch me emotionally. At just around 2,5h to play, I very much recommend this.</p><p>4/5 plushy pigs</p></main><footer><p>© 2023 Robert Lützner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS Feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
