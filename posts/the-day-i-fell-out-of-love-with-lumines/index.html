<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=/tags/life>life</a><br><b>Estimated reading time: </b>5 minutes<article><p>&mldr;was yesterday. üòÖ</p><p>Even back on the PSP, I always wanted to play Lumines, because it looked like an refreshing tetris-like puzzler to me. For me, this was before digital downloads &ndash; at least PSN downloads, so I never ended up getting it.</p><p>But my excitement rekindled when I saw that a Remaster arrived on the Nintendo Switch. And I spent countless hours in <em>Challenge Mode</em>, trying to get to Level 100.</p><p>And eventually, I beat it.</p><p>And beat it again.</p><p>And then again.</p><p>So, I took a long break from it. I would occasionally return for a session or two, but in the meantime I had become consistent at beating <em>Challenge Mode</em>. I tried some of the other modes, but they didn&rsquo;t engage me as much. While I find <em>Puzzle Mode</em> interesting, I never quite got the hang of how I was supposed to create the given patterns. I feel like I got them right often enough, but it wouldn&rsquo;t count.</p><p>Yesterday, I whipped out my Switch again. I hadn&rsquo;t turned it on in over a year and I wasn&rsquo;t actually expecting to play anything right away. My oldest kid is now getting interested in videogames. We&rsquo;ve used these occasions for a bit of parental downtime the last few weeks, but I feel like he&rsquo;s unhappy to play all by himself. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re not present, but we&rsquo;re not really enganged in his activity.</p><p>This mainly started because he got interested in the controller I left lying around after an evening gaming session. I explained that you can control things on screen with it&mldr;aaaaaand because the floating question marks in front of his face were nearly tangible, I fired up the PC and installed a few Linux classics: Extreme Tux Racer and Super Tux Kart. üòÅ</p><p>He got really into Super Tux Kart, even though ultimately I think he&rsquo;s too young for the complex controls. Extreme Tux Racer (that&rsquo;s the one with the penguin sliding down a snowy slope) is better suited, because it only requires directional inputs, but then again&mldr;it doesn&rsquo;t have cars. üòÖ</p><p>Long story short: I was looking to fire up Mario Kart, get it back into the quick selection and maybe even go a lap or two.</p><p>And then I saw Lumines. üò±</p><p>It was perfect. I had a real shitty Wednesday and all the days after were immensely exhausting. Turning off my brain and getting into flow seemed like exactly what I needed.</p><p>I fired it up and immediately selected <em>Challenge Mode</em>. No time to mess around.</p><p>I ended up playing it for thirty minutes and then spent another twenty minutes absentmindedly clearing block after block while contemplating that I really wasn&rsquo;t having that much fun.</p><p>I never really enjoyed the music, which reviews kept saying is integral to the gameplay. It kinda is and so I never turned it off or even tried to play without it. While it definitely is part of the whole vibe&mldr;I think it kinda sucks. Not trying to offend anybody, if you&rsquo;re really into it &ndash; hey, it&rsquo;s cool. But I feel like I&rsquo;m pretty open to almost all kinds of music, but this weirdly falls into one of my blind spots.</p><p>Disregarding the music, and this might be something that&rsquo;s due to me getting older, but there&rsquo;s just soooooooo much shit going down on the screen. I&rsquo;m not epileptic or anything and I can take all the flashing colors, but after a while I noticed that my eyes and to a certain extent my brain started hurting. Every five levels, the background and after a while the color and form of the blocks changes and the longer you play, the more messed up the backgrounds get. Mixed in are more and more foreground effects, flashy block clearing explosions and the like, that I really didn&rsquo;t care all that much for. I do like getting feedback when I clear blocks, but this is clearly meant to be the actual challenge.</p><p>And that is pretty much where I left off. When I noticed that the <em>real</em> challenge is not</p><ul><li>the game speeding up (it does, but it also slows down) or</li><li>the rhythm changing (which means you have to wait longer for blocks to clear).</li></ul><p>Ultimately the biggest challenge is ignoring all the strobing lights, bouncing background colors, annoying music and voice samples and just keep a clear head. And that is simply not that exciting after I maanged to do it once.</p><p>I played until Level 76, which took me around fifty minutes. At that point the thought of soldiering on drained the rest of my already bottomed out energy. I kept going for much longer than I should have, because the thought of &ldquo;can I still beat this without practice&rdquo; kept popping into my head.</p><p>I finally saw reason that this question isn&rsquo;t actually all that interesting. I was doing pretty well at Level 76 and I probably would have beat it again.</p><p>But I did the only right thing: fast drop all incoming blocks until I game overed and went to bed. üò¥</p><p>I should have done this an hour earlier&mldr;</p><hr><p>Did you like what you read?
