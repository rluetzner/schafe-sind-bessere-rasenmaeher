<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=/tags/piracy>piracy</a><br><b>Estimated reading time: </b>4 minutes<article><p><a href=https://archive.org>Archive.org</a> has been through a lot of trouble in the last few weeks. Multiple DDoS attacks, a huge leak of sensitive data and constant legal trouble.</p><p>I can remember neither the author, nor in which context specifically I ran across the following statement. It went something like this.</p><blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re obsessed with preserving content for &ldquo;the future&rdquo;, but there&rsquo;s no rhyme or reason as to what we want to archive.</p><p>Imagine digging up Pharaoh Ramses&rsquo; shopping list.</p><p>It needs to be okay when things get lost.</p></blockquote><p>At first I vaguely agreed with this statement, but it&rsquo;s been bugging me for a while now.</p><p>If we&rsquo;re really looking 2000 years into the future, I totally agree that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;okay when things get lost&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a ton of things on Archive.org that simply won&rsquo;t matter in 100, 200 or 1000 years.</p><p>But are we really talking about that time frame though?</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t used Archive.org extensively. The most relevant thing I can remember is downloading ISOs for Resident Evil 1 (1996), Resident Evil 2 (1998) and Resident Evil 3 (1999). These games were unavailable for the longest time until <a href=https://gog.com>GOG</a> made them available again <strong>a few months ago</strong>! <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>There were a few other old games I looked up on Archive.org. I browsed a few old manuals and looked at long gone websites with the <em>Wayback Machine</em>.</p><p>We&rsquo;re not talking about 2000 year old information getting lost!!!</p><p>We&rsquo;re actually looking at media that was created <strong>in my lifetime</strong> and which is slowly, but surely being swept away.</p><p>Just recently I read a post on the Fediverse about how people of all ages were watching a screening of Akira Kurosawa&rsquo;s <em>Seven Samurai</em> in the movie theater. A grandpa went to watch it with their teenage grandchild. A couple around my age were watching it for the first time.</p><p>Imagine not being able to watch this movie that came out 70 years ago (in 1954)!</p><p>Or <em>Star Wars</em> (1977).</p><p>Or how about reading Orwell&rsquo;s 1948 masterpiece <em>1984</em> &ndash; more relevant than ever!?</p><p>All of these are pretty easy to come by. They were released as physical media.</p><p>But as you may have noticed, this no longer happens.</p><p>&ldquo;Physical&rdquo; videogame releases are tied to online platforms, e.g. Steam, and the package you can buy often just contains a key to register the game.</p><p>Amazon, Sony, Netflix and other streaming services have been caught removing or editing digital media. Media that is <strong>only</strong> available digitally &ndash; or have you seen physical copies of the last few <em>Stranger Things</em> seasons?</p><p>Additionally, after a lot of legal fights, these services are now forced to admit you are not actually <em>buying</em> digital media. Steam and Amazon now prominently display that they are just <em>licensing</em> this media to you. A license that gives those companies any rights to revoke it at any time.</p><p>Also&mldr;are these companies gonna be around in 2000 years for you to access your copy of <em>Dark Souls</em>? Probably not!</p><p>And this isn&rsquo;t limited to popular streaming services. Think about scientific papers, which are gated by a few publishers which want insane amounts of money for information that should be free to be shared, discussed and learned from.</p><p>So while we are indeed &ldquo;obsessed&rdquo; with preserving things, you&rsquo;ll need to look behind the curtain and see what&rsquo;s causing it. People are slowly waking up to this mass destruction of media &ndash; again, things that have been created in the last few decades.</p><p>It&rsquo;s okay when things get lost.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t care if archaeologists in the far future discover a scratched copy of Resident Evil or not.</p><p>But I do care if I can show my kids my favorite videogames, movies or books when they grow up.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I do actually own all three games physically, but they are lost somewhere in the chaotic bowels of my cellar. I also bought digital copies as soon as GOG announced them.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br><span xmlns:dct=http://purl.org/dc/terms/ href=http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text property="dct:title" rel=dct:type><i>Who are we archiving for?</i></span> written by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=/posts/who-are-we-archiving-for/ property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionURL>Robert Lützner</a> is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</main><footer><p>© 2024 Robert Lützner</p><a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester rel=me target=blank>Mastodon</a> | <a href=https://codeberg.org/rluetzner>Codeberg</a> | <a href=/imprint/>Contact Me</a> | <a href=/rss>RSS Feeds</a> | <a href=/imprint>Imprint</a></p></footer></body></html>
