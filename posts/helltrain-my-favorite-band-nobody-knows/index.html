<a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark tag-btn" href=/tags/metal>metal</a><article><p>I initially intended to post a few songs on Mastodon and talk about my history with <a href=https://helltrain.bandcamp.com>Helltrain</a>, but I quickly learned that this would be better suited to a blog post. So here we are&mldr;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had Helltrain stuck in my ears for about a week. In particular this morning the chorus to <em>Route 666</em> was stuck on repeat, so I tortured my kids with a bit of &ldquo;Dad music&rdquo; while prepping breakfast. üòÅ</p><blockquote><p>I am the bastard son, evil inborn,<br>Satan in tiptop from head to toe.<br>Just look at me riding, sense my blitz,<br>down riding Route 666.</p></blockquote><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.yewtu.be/embed/3YzRyjDLov8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Route 666 by Helltrain"></iframe></div><p>This is the first song I ever heard. I stumbled upon this band via a short album review on laut.de &ndash; which weirdly enough is <a href=https://laut.de/Helltrain/Alben/Route-666-7364>still online</a>.</p><p>The article was released on the 25th October of 2004, so that dates my first encounter pretty well. ü§£</p><p>In hindsight it&rsquo;s a bit weird that the band resonated that much with me. This is way before I got into Amon Amarth &ndash; over a decade even. Back in 2004 I mostly listened to AC/DC, Iron Maiden and the like. Clean vocals, mellow atmosphere. I think I even kept away from Metallica back then. I might have listened to Nine Inch Nails, but that doesn&rsquo;t really fit anywhere, does it? üòÖ</p><p>And along comes this rowdy aggressive in-your-face band and I was totally enamoured with it. I guess despite the growled vocals, the atmosphere of music is actually pretty upbeat. All their songs have a kind of low, &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; groove &ndash; basically a wall of sound. And they are layered with high melodies, which is what makes them sound upbeat.</p><p>Pretty much the same explanation that I found for Mot√∂rhead: once I understood that it&rsquo;s basically Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll with distorted guitars I immediately understood why I liked them so much. üòÖ</p><p>Other than a lot of bands, I don&rsquo;t know much about Helltrain. They are a swedish band and have released 3 albums and a few loose tracks at the time I&rsquo;m writing this. I also know that their drummer died a few years ago, but they&rsquo;ve been active since. In fact, according to Bandcamp, the latest single <em>Mischief</em> was released on the 26th of May 2023 &ndash; this year!</p><p>They themselves describe their music as &ldquo;Punk rot&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll&rdquo; (at least they used to üòÖ). I&rsquo;d say it lives somewhere between being groovy as classic Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll songs, with the wall of sound that comes with a lot of metal and aggressively growled vocals. There&rsquo;s also an organ in there sometimes. üòÅ</p><p>Apparently nowadays they go by Death&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll, which is fine by me.</p><p>Very similar though to other bands, I tend to forget about Helltrain for years until suddenly a chorus or a certain melody pops into my mind and I go: &ldquo;Hell yeah, that was a great band. I should listen to them again.&rdquo;</p><p>So Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll Devil was released in 2008 and I probably listened to it two or three years later and was delighted to have a new Helltrain album.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.yewtu.be/embed/Xtt3hcXYnv0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="The official Rock'n'Roll devil music video by Helltrain"></iframe></div><p>I remember not liking it much when I listened to it for the first time, but it snuck it&rsquo;s way into my ear after a while. However, to this day it remains their album I&rsquo;ve listened to the least. I should remedy that immediately. ü§£</p><p>Relistening to it today, I think it was just a bit too dark at the time. While there are still some amazingly groovy songs that make you want to drop everything to dance and jump around like a maniac, there are also some more tempered and thoughtful &ndash; dark &ndash; songs like <em>My little stars</em>.</p><p>And holding up the tradition of forgetting about the band, I was overjoyed &ndash; probably also three or so years later &ndash; when I heard that they had released <em>Death is coming</em> in 2012.</p><p>It remains the only album that I don&rsquo;t physically own, because &ndash; hold on to your hats &ndash; they released it and all their previous albums as a <strong>free</strong> download on their homepage <a href=https://helltrain.net>https://helltrain.net</a> <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. I always wanted to throw some money their way, because I wanted the physical release, but it looks like I missed my chance. üò¢</p><p>Anyway, queue the &ldquo;same old, same old&rdquo; &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t like it when I first listened to it. Especially the opening tracks are either much heavier or much more aggressive. I&rsquo;ve since come around on both of them. <em>Juggernauters</em> sets the mood just right and <em>Death is coming</em> is a great heavy, slow-groove song.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.yewtu.be/embed/vnrNXDP-jrs style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Death is coming by Helltrain"></iframe></div><aside>Relistening to the song right now, I&rsquo;m not sure if <em>slow</em> is the right word. I kinda always only think of the chorus which has this amazing &ldquo;Death is co<strong>ming</strong>&rdquo; growl in it that slows it down a bit. üòÖ</aside><p>And next to these heavy hitters there is <em>The killer come</em>. Nothing to add, I rest my case. There&rsquo;s a real nice surprise at the end. üòÅ This is fucking great Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;Roll!!!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about the surprise&mldr;<details><summary>Spoilers!!! Open on your own risk!</summary>I&rsquo;m talking about the piano solo. üòÅ</details></p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.yewtu.be/embed/jmqqBVMDScw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="The killer come by Helltrain"></iframe></div><p>I always feel a bit sad that there&rsquo;s not more talk about Helltrain. Even though there are as many swedish metal bands as there are grains of sand, I feel that Helltrain has what it takes to rise above the rest &ndash; oh wait&mldr;</p><p>Okay I have to mention it, because depending on which tracks you listen to, you&rsquo;ll be able to hear it for yourself. The singer doesn&rsquo;t exactly have a healthy way of growling. This is unproblematic when you&rsquo;re recording an album and can take all the time you need to get it right, but it will break your neck in live performances.</p><p>I really want to believe that Helltrain are a real fun live band, but the only watch- and listenable recording I found online is this here&mldr;</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.yewtu.be/embed/-gtGYXESHQM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Death in Kyiv, Ukraine a full live concert by Helltrain"></iframe></div><p>You can tell that his voice tires quickly and he&rsquo;s hoarse and barely singing after just a few songs. I&rsquo;m not a professional singer, so I can&rsquo;t really tell if what I&rsquo;m saying is accurate, but to me it doesn&rsquo;t sound healthy &ndash; it sounds like it should really <strong>hurt</strong>. üò¨</p><p>It&rsquo;s also possible that this one sample recording I have is not representative of their live performance and I really, really, really want to believe that that&rsquo;s the case.</p><p>Anyway, I do hope that the guys are happy doing what they do, because I am still very much happy to listen what they put out. Here&rsquo;s to more from my favorite band nobody knows. üçª</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The website is no longer active and redirects to <a href=https://www.swedishmetal.se/category/helltrain>https://www.swedishmetal.se/category/helltrain</a> .
