<time datetime=2024-04-26>26. Apr 2024</time><article><h2 id=-hi-there-im-robert>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I&rsquo;m Robert!</h2><p>So, what&rsquo;s this about?</p><p>Initially this was a blog where I posted my short stories (which are currently exclusively written in German). After a while however I noticed the urge to write about different stuff.</p><h3 id=who-are-you-again>Who are you again?</h3><p>I work as a software developer and as such encounter some bizarre situations at work. I also self-host a bunch of services for my family.</p><p>I play games, read books and watch movies and oftentimes don&rsquo;t have anyone to talk to about these. Most of the movies I watch is stuff that my wife wouldn&rsquo;t touch with a ten foot pole.</p><h3 id=aha-what-about-the-blog>Aha! What about the blog?</h3><p>My first idea was to start a new blog: Sheepy on stuff (keeping with the sheep theme). However, I already own two domains and have no intent of buying another one, even though they can be pretty cheap.</p><p>I came across the idea of a <a href=https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history>digital garden</a> which is kinda what I want to do, but also not really. I&rsquo;m not quite sure if I want this blog to be an ever changing wiki.</p><p>However, getting rid of the restriction to only publish German short stories unlocked something for me. Due to my work and almost all media I consume being in English, I often tend to formulate my thoughts in English as well. I often found myself thinking out blog posts in English, which I previously couldn&rsquo;t possibly publish on this blog.</p><p><strong>NO MORE!!!</strong></p><p>This is now a bilingual blog. Not in the sense that everything will be translated, but rather that any page will be either in German or English. Or both.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not collecting any metrics, so I don&rsquo;t know if I do have some loyal followers. I&rsquo;ll probably piss some of them off. That&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>In the end I realized that anything I publish here is not primarily for the public. This is kind of a digital diary for my future self to revel in. It&rsquo;s okay if I end up being the only follower.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re not welcome to help out. If you find any spelling issues or want to improve on an article, feel free to send me a <a href=https://github.com/rluetzner/schafe-sind-bessere-rasenmaeher>pull request on GitHub</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also happy to discuss any of the articles posted here. The best way is probably to contact me via <a href=https://rollenspiel.social/@mforester>Mastodon / The Fediverse</a>, where I can link any public discussion to the article.</p><h2 id=licensing>Licensing</h2><p>Apart from a few exceptions my short stories, poems and photos are licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode.de>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>.</p><p>Articles that do not specify a license should be treated as licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode.de>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>.
